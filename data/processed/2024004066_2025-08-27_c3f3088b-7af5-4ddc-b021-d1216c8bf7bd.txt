STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Claimed Subject Matter
Claims 1 and 21 are independent. Claim 1, reproduced below, is
illustrative of the claimed subject matter.
1. An ultrasound imaging system for shear wave imaging
comprising:
a probe configured to acquire ultrasound echo signals for
producing shear wave images of anisotropic tissue of a subject,
wherein the probe is configured to be coupled to a position
tracking system for tracking a position of the probe with respect
to the subject;
a processor in communication with the probe and
configured to receive position tracking data from the position
tracking system, wherein the processor further is configured to:
define at least one target plane in the anisotropic
tissue at an a [sic] first angle with respect to and using a
reference plane of the anisotropic tissue;
determine a second angle between a position of an
imaging plane of the probe as indicated by the position
tracking data and the reference plane;
define a first transformation between a position of
the at least one target plane and the reference plane
based, at least in part, on the first angle;
define a second transformation between the
position of the image plane and the reference plane
based, at least in part, on the second angle;
determine a difference between the position of the
image plane and the position of the target plane using the
first and second transformations; and
provide a visual indicator of the difference on a
display of the ultrasound system, wherein the processor is
configured to dynamically update the visual indicator
responsive to a change in the position of the imaging
plane with respect to the target plane.

ANALYSIS
Claim 1 calls for a processor configured to “define at least one target
plane in the anisotropic tissue at an a [sic] first angle with respect to and
using a reference plane of the anisotropic tissue.” Appeal Br. 20, Claims
App. Independent claim 21 includes a similar recitation, i.e., “defining at
least one target plane using the reference plane and an a [sic] first angle
between the at least one target plane and the reference plane.” Id. at 23.
These claim recitations require that the reference plane is used to define the
at least one target plane.
The Examiner finds that Toma teaches a processor configured to
“define at least one target plane in the anisotropic tissue . . . at a first angle
with respect to a reference plane of the anisotropic tissue” (Final Act. 3–4),
but “does not specifically teach using a reference plane to define at least one
target plane” (id. at 5). The Examiner does not rely on the teachings of
Parthasarathy to remedy this deficiency, rather the Examiner appears to rely
on the teachings of Kondoh. See id. at 5–6. Specifically, the Examiner finds
that “Kondoh . . . teaches using a reference plane to define at least one target

Appeal 2024-004066
Application 17/262,390

5

plane.” Final Act. 6. The Examiner supports this finding by explaining that
Kondoh teaches “a suitable angle at which the ultrasound probe should be
positioned in relation a plane parallel to a carotid artery is displayed to the
user. The position of the suitable angle is considered the target plane and the
plane parallel to the carotid artery is considered the reference plane.” Id.
(emphasis omitted) (citing Kondoh ¶ 121); Ans. 4–5. Thereafter, the
Examiner combines the teachings of Toth in view of Parthasarathy and
Kondoh as a “simple substitution of one known element for another to
obtain the predictable results of determining how much the ultrasound probe
needs to move to be aligned with the target plane.” Id. at 7.
The Appellant argues that the Examiner’s reliance on both Toma’s
and Kondoh’s teachings to result in the processor configured to “define at
least one target plane in the anisotropic tissue at an a [sic] first angle with
respect to and using a reference plane of the anisotropic tissue,” as recited in
claim 1, is inadequate and confusing. See Appeal Br. 16; see also id. at 13.
The Examiner responds to the Appellant’s argument by focusing on
the teachings of Toma. See Ans. 6–7. Specifically, the Examiner responds
as follows:
Examiner notes that as previously set forth Toma does not use
the reference plane to define at least one target plane but does
teach defining at least one a target plane at a first angle with
respect to a reference plane. Specifically, fig. 2c of Toma
shows the “measurement target region” (solid line box) which
corresponds to a target plane is defined on the longitudinal axis
of the carotid artery (reference plane). By defining a target
plane, Toma is also defining the target plane at a first angle
with respect to a reference plane because the claims do not
require that a first angle actually be defined, they only require
the target plane to be at an angle with respect to a reference
plane. Therefore, by defining the measurement target region of

Toma in relation to the longitudinal axis of the carotid artery
(reference plane), Toma is defining a target plane at a first angle
with respect to a reference plane.
Ans. 6–7 (emphasis added). Accordingly, it is clear that the Examiner does
not rely on Toma to disclose the claim requirement that the reference plane
is used to define the at least one target plane.
Nonetheless, we, like the Appellant, are confused by the Examiner’s
rejection as it relates to claim 1’s processor, which is configured to “define
at least one target plane in the anisotropic tissue at an a [sic] first angle with
respect to and using a reference plane of the anisotropic tissue.” We note
that the Examiner’s rejection is based on a simple substitution of one known
article for another. See Final Act. 7. Therefore, the Examiner’s response to
the Appellant’s argument should, at the very least, include a discussion of
how Kondoh teaches the entirety of the claimed processor’s operation to
“define at least one target plane in the anisotropic tissue at an a [sic] first
angle with respect to and using a reference plane of the anisotropic tissue.”
In this regard, and as best understood, the Examiner finds that
Kondoh’s suitable angle (i.e., the first angle) is used to determine a plane
parallel to a carotid artery (i.e., the reference plane) and the position at
which the ultrasound probe should be positioned (i.e., the at least one target
plane). See Final Act. 6 (citing Kondoh ¶ 121); Ans. 4–5. However, the
Examiner fails to adequately explain on the record how Kondoh teaches that
the plane parallel to a carotid artery (i.e., the reference plane) is used to
define the position at which the ultrasound probe should be positioned (i.e.,
the at least one target plane). See Appeal Br. 13. Therefore, we fail to
understand how the Examiner adequately supports the finding that Kondoh
teaches the claimed processor’s operation to “define at least one target plane

Appeal 2024-004066
Application 17/262,390

7

in the anisotropic tissue at an a [sic] first angle with respect to and using a
reference plane of the anisotropic tissue.”
Thus, we reverse the Examiner’s rejection of independent claim 1 and
its dependent claims under as unpatentable over Toma, Parthasarathy, and
Kondoh. The Examiner’s rejection of independent claim 21 and its
dependent claims under as unpatentable over Toma, Parthasarathy, and
Kondoh is reversed for a similar reason. We likewise reverse the
Examiner’s rejections of dependent claims 4, 6–11, 13, 15, 18, 19, and 25
because, as best understood, these rejections do not include an adequate
basis to cure the deficiency in the rejection of the independent claims.
