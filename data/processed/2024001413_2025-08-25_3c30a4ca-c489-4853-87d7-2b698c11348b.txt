STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Claims 1–18, 20, and 21 are pending, stand rejected, are appealed by
Appellant, and are the subject of our decision under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a).1
See Final Act. 1, 2; Appeal Br. 5.2 We have jurisdiction under
35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM IN PART.
CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claimed subject matter, according to Appellant, generally “relates
to a method and system for detecting suction conditions in a patient having
an implantable blood pump.” Spec. ¶ 3. An exemplary embodiment
describes “a method of detecting a suction condition during operation of a
rotary blood pump . . . connected to a ventricle” (id. ¶ 7), i.e., “a ventricular
assist device or ‘VAD’” (id. ¶ 4), by “measuring the rotational speed of [a]
rotor” (id. ¶ 7). See Spec. ¶¶ 4–26; Abstr. Claim 1 (directed to a method)
and claim 11 (directed to a device) are independent. Claim 1, reproduced
below, is illustrative of the claimed subject matter:

1 We use the term “Appellant” to refer to “applicant” as defined in 37 C.F.R.
§ 1.42. Appellant identifies the real party in interest as Heart Ware, Inc.
Appeal Br. 3. The Appellant has assigned their interest to Boston Scientific
Scimed, Inc. See Assignment dated Nov. 22, 2024. Appellant is reminded
of its obligation to update its real party in interest information within 20 days
of any change during the appeal. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.8(a).
2 We refer to Appellant’s Specification (“Spec.”), filed Apr. 28, 2020;
Appeal Brief (“Appeal Br.”), filed Aug. 1, 2023; and Reply Brief (“Reply
Br.”), filed Feb. 1, 2024. We also refer to the Examiner’s Final Office
Action (“Final Act.”), mailed Feb. 13, 2023; and Answer (“Ans.”), mailed
Dec. 1, 2023.

Appeal 2024-001413

1. A method of detecting a suction condition during
operation of a blood pump at a set rotational speed, the method
comprising:
monitoring, by a control circuit configured to maintain a
speed of a rotor of the blood pump within a range around the set
rotational speed, a flow rate of blood through the blood pump
for a period of time during one or more cardiac cycles of a
patient;
determining, by the control circuit, a duty parameter
representing a proportion of the period of time during which the
flow rate is above a crossover flow rate; and
generating, by the control circuit, a suction detect signal
based at least in part on the duty parameter.
Appeal Br. 13 (Claims App.).

ANALYSIS
Anticipation
The Examiner rejects claims 1–18, 20, and 21 as being anticipated by
Medvedev. See Final Act. 4–8; Ans. 10–12. Specifically, with respect to
claim 1, the Examiner finds that Medvedev discloses “determining, by [a]
control circuit, a duty parameter representing a proportion of the time during
which the flow rate is above a crossover flow rate.” Final Act. 4–5 (citing
Medvedev col. 6, l. 39–col. 7, l. 28 and col. 7, l. 56–col. 8, l. 3); see Ans.
10–12.
Appellant contends Medvedev does not disclose the limitations of
claim 1. See Appeal Br. 5–8; Reply Br. 6–8. Specifically, Appellant
contends, inter alia, that “[n]one of the techniques for detecting a presuction condition described in Medvedev utilize ‘a duty parameter
representing a proportion of the period of time during which the flow rate
is above a crossover flow rate’” (Appeal Br. 5) and
None of the various techniques for calculating DQ described in
Medvedev are based on a proportion of a period of time , much
less determined using “a proportion of the period of time during
which the flow rate is above a c rossover flow rate,” as set forth
in claim 1. Instead, all the disclosed techniques for determining
DQ utilize only a peak maximum flow rate, a peak minimum
flow rate, and/or a mean flow rate. That is, all the techniques
described in Medvedev determine DQ based on magnitudes of
the flow rate measurements, and not “a proportion of the period
of time during which the flow rate is above a crossover flow
rate.”
Appeal Br. 6.
We find Appellant’s arguments persuasive of Examiner error. As
pointed out by Appellant, nothing in the Examiner’s cited portions of

Appeal 2024-001413
Application 16/860,594

5
Medvedev explicitly discloses calculating a duty parameter that represents a
fraction (proportion) of a period of time (e.g., multiple cardiac cycles—see
Ans. 11) in which the flow rate is above (greater than) a crossover flow rate
(i.e., the average flow rate). See Appeal Br. 5–8; Reply Br. 6–8; Medvedev
col. 6, l. 39–col. 7, l. 28 and col. 7, l. 56–col. 8, l. 3. Although Medvedev’s
Q (flow rate) measurements include a mean flow rate (Qmean) and an average
maximum instantaneous pump flow (Qpeak(+)) (see Medvedev col. 6, ll. 59–
66) that implicate a time component (are calculated over a time period)
Medvedev’s flow pulsatility (DQ) is not a measure of time or a proportion of
time. Contrary to the Examiner’s interpretation of claim 1 and Medvedev
(see Ans. 10–11), determining magnitudes of flow rates and pulsatility over
a “control cycle” and/or cardiac cycles does not disclose
calculating/determining a fraction of time value as required by claim 1.
Accordingly, the Examiner has not sufficiently shown that Medvedev
discloses the disputed features of claim 1.
We are a Board of review, and not a place of initial examination. On
the record before us, we cannot affirm the Examiner’s rejection based upon
any degree of speculation on our part. We cannot sustain the Examiner’s
rejection without some concrete objective evidence in the record supporting
the Examiner’s underlying factual finding and legal conclusions. See, e.g.,
Vaidyanathan, 381 F. App’x 985, 993 (Fed. Cir. 2010), and In re Wallen,
565 F. App’x 867, 869 (Fed. Cir. 2014), both citing In re Zurko, 258 F.3d
1379, 1386 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (“[T]he Board must point to some concrete
evidence in the record in support of these findings. To hold otherwise would
render the process of appellate review for substantial evidence on
the record a meaningless exercise.” (footnote omitted) (citation omitted)).

Appeal 2024-001413
Application 16/860,594

6
Consequently, we are constrained by the record before us to find that
the Examiner erred in finding Medvedev anticipates Appellant’s claim 1.
Independent claim 11 includes limitations of commensurate scope.
Dependent claims 2–10, 12–18, 20, and 21 depend from and stand with
claims 1 and 11, respectively. Thus, we do not sustain the Examiner’s
anticipation rejection of claims 1–18, 20, and 21.
Eligibility
The Examiner rejects claims 1–9 and 21 as being directed to patentineligible subject matter. See Ans. 8–10. Appellant argues independent
claim 1 and claims 2–9 and 21 together as a group (with respect to the
subject matter eligibility rejection). See Reply Br. 2–6. We select
independent claim 1 as representative of Appellant’s arguments with respect
to claims 1–9 and 21. See 37 C.F.R. § 1.37(c)(1)(iv) (2022).
We have reviewed the Examiner’s rejection in light of Appellant’s
arguments in the Reply Brief that the Examiner has erred. On this record,
we are not persuaded by Appellant’s arguments, we disagree with
Appellant’s conclusions, and we find Appellant has not identified an error in
the Examiner’s subject matter eligibility rejection. Except as otherwise
noted, we concur with the determinations reached by the Examiner and we
adopt as our own (1) the findings, reasons, and conclusions set forth by the
Examiner in the Examiner’s Answer (see Ans. 8–10). We highlight the
following points.




Appeal 2024-001413
Application 16/860,594

The Examiner’s § 101 Rejection—Alice/Mayo Framework:
Parts 1 and 2
Applying the Alice/Mayo4 framework using the 2019 Revised
Guidance,5 the Examiner determines that claim 1 recites abstract mental
processes. See Ans. 8–9. Further applying the Alice/Mayo framework, the
Examiner determines that the additional elements of claim 1 do not integrate
the abstract idea into a practical application. See id. at 9. The Examiner
then determines these additional elements are not “sufficient to amount to
significantly more than the judicial exception” (do not evince an “inventive
concept”). Id. at 10.
Statutory Subject Matter
Independent claim 1 recites “[a] method of detecting a suction
condition during operation of a blood pump at a set rotational speed.”
Appeal Br. 13 (Claims App.). Appellant’s claim delineates a method for
performing the recited operations, i.e., processes for “detecting suction
conditions in a patient having an implantable blood pump.” Spec. ¶ 3.
Accordingly, Appellant’s claim 1 falls within the process category of
invention (USPTO Step 1). See Ans. 8.
Step 2A, Prong 1: Does the Claim Recite a Judicial
Exception (Abstract Idea)?
The Examiner determined that claim 1 recites limitations that are
mental processes. See Ans. 8–9 (quoting claim 1). The Examiner further

Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 75–77
(2012)).
5 See Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (“MPEP”) § 2106 (9th ed., rev.
01.2024, Nov. 2024).

determines that the steps of “determining . . . a duty parameter” and
“generating . . . a suction detect signal . . . based on the duty parameter” “can
be performed by a human using a mental process” and, therefore, the claim
limitation(s) “falls within the ‘Mental Process’ grouping of abstract ideas.”
Id. at 9; see MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)(III).
Appellant contends that claim 1 does not recite an abstract idea. See
Reply Br. 2–5. Specifically, Appellant contends, inter alia, that the method
of claim 1 “includes one or more limitations that cannot practically be
performed by the human mind” and cites CardioNet6 in support of the
contention that “complex data acquisition and manipulation” does not
constitute mental processes. Reply Br. 2. See id. at 2–5.
We disagree with Appellant’s contentions. In rejecting claim 1 under
35 U.S.C. § 101, the Examiner analyzed the claims using the Mayo/Alice
two-step framework, consistent with the guidance set forth in the USPTO’s
Revised Patent Subject Matter Eligibility Guidance. Appellant, on the other
hand, provides conclusory arguments that claim 1 does not recite mental
processes, and misconstrues the applicable legal precedent (the CardioNet
case).
Contrary to Appellant’s contentions, CardioNet is inapposite to
Appellant’s claim 1. In CardioNet, the court explained that the claims at
issue focused on a specific means for improving cardiac monitoring
technology, and were “not ‘directed to a result or effect that itself is the
abstract idea and merely invoke generic processes and machinery.’”
CardioNet, 955 F.3d at 1368 (quoting McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games

6 CardioNet, LLC v. InfoBionic, Inc., 955 F.3d 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2020)
(“CardioNet”).

Am. Inc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2016)). In other words, the court
found the claims were directed to a technical improvement (under the
USPTO’s Step 2A, Prong 2 analysis), not that the claims could not be
performed in the human mind, as Appellant contends. Further, Appellant’s
claim 1 is unlike the claims in CardioNet that recite a physical system
incorporating beat detectors (sensors) and improved techniques for using
raw data, and which were found not to be directed to an abstract idea
“because they focused on a specific means or method that improved cardiac
monitoring technology, improving the detection of, and allowing more
reliable and immediate treatment of, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.”
iLife Technologies, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 839 F. App’x 534, 537
(Fed. Cir. 2021) (citing CardioNet, 955 F.3d at 1368). In contrast, claim 1 is
not focused on a specific means or method to improve blood pump
monitoring systems, nor is it directed to a specific physical configuration of
detectors.
Rather, Appellant’s claim 1 recites a straight-forward mental process
of determining a data value—a duty parameter—and the pre-solution
activity of monitoring a flow rate using undisclosed and unclaimed control
circuit technology. Appellant contends that
claim 1, much like the CardioNet claims, recites several data
acquisition and manipulation steps that cannot practically be
performed mentally or manually, and therefore, . . . the subject
matter of claim 1 does not constitute a mental process. For
example, it is completely impractical to think that a human could
“monitor[] . . . a flow rate of blood through the blood pump for a
period of time during one or more cardiac cycles of a patient” at
a rate and accuracy sufficient to “determin[e] . . . a duty
parameter representing a proportion of the period of time during

Appeal 2024-001413
Application 16/860,594

10
which the flow rate is above a crossover flow rate” and use that
duty parameter to detect a suction condition in a blood pump.
Reply Br. 5. Appellant, however, does not explain why the monitoring and
determining functions cannot be performed mentally (using, e.g.,
undisclosed and unclaimed sensors and computer components (including the
control circuit, discussed infra)). Appellant’s monitoring (i.e., datagathering) step (operation) amounts to insignificant pre-solution activity.
See In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 963 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (en banc), aff’d Bilski v.
Kappos, 561 U.S. 593 (2010) (characterizing data gathering steps as
insignificant extra-solution activity); see also Versata Development Group,
Inc. v. SAP America, Inc., 793 F.3d 1306, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (“retrieving
applicable” data and “storing” the data (pricing information) amount to
standard computer “activities”); OIP Techs., Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 788
F.3d 1359, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (sending and receiving data over a network
amounts to “routine data-gathering steps” and “storing . . . results” amounts
to standard “computer activities”); buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc., 765 F.3d
1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (The recited “computer functionality is
generic,” “[t]hat a computer receives and sends the information over a
network—with no further specification—is not even arguably inventive.”);
CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions, Inc., 654 F.3d 1366, 1371–72 (Fed.
Cir. 2011) (noting that even if some physical steps are required to obtain
information from a database (e.g., entering a query via a keyboard, clicking
a mouse), such data-gathering steps cannot alone confer patentability);
accord MPEP § 2106.05(g) (“The term ‘extra-solution activity’ can be
understood as activities incidental to the primary process or product that are
merely a nominal or tangential addition to the claim. Extra-solution activity
includes both pre-solution and post-solution activity.”).

Appeal 2024-001413
Application 16/860,594

11
With respect to Appellant’s determining (of a duty parameter), this
step (operation) recites determining a proportion or fraction of time the
monitored flow rate is greater than an average (crossover) flow rate. See
Spec. ¶¶ 53–62; Figs. 5, 6. Determining an average flow rate, comparing
flow rates to the average, and determining a period of time the flow rate
exceeds the average (none of which are affirmatively recited in the claim),
and determining a fraction (proportion) of time (the recited limitation) can
be performed by a human, using observation, evaluation, and judgment,
because the steps involve making evaluations and judgments (calculations
and/or determinations), which are mental tasks humans routinely perform in
the course carrying out a process for evaluating data (using, for example,
pen and paper). See Appellant’s Figures 5 and 6, illustrating the recited
determination. See In re Killian, 45 F.4th 1373, 1379–1380 (Fed. Cir.
2022); MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)(III).
Further, it is well-settled that collecting information, as well as
analyzing information by steps people go through in their minds, are
essentially mental processes within the abstract-idea category. See
FairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Systems, Inc., 839 F.3d 1089, 1093 (Fed. Cir.
2016); see also Elec. Power Grp., LLC v. Alstom S.A., 830 F.3d 1350, 1354
(Fed. Cir. 2016) (“[W]e have treated analyzing information by steps people
go through in their minds, or by mathematical algorithms, without more, as
essentially mental processes within the abstract-idea category.”).
Appellant’s monitoring and determining operations are akin to the claims
directed to an abstract mental process in Elec. Power Grp. See Elec. Power
Grp., 830 F.3d at 1353 (“The claims . . . fall into a familiar class of claims
‘directed to’ a patent-ineligible concept. The focus of the asserted claims

Appeal 2024-001413
Application 16/860,594

12
. . . is on collecting information, analyzing it, and displaying certain results
of the collection and analysis.”).
It matters not for our analysis that such mental analysis might be
cumbersome. See, e.g., Int’l Business Machines Corp. v. Zillow Grp., Inc.,
50 F.4th 1371, 1381–82 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (finding, with respect to a patent
purporting to solve the problem “that the display of ‘any system that has
large numbers of objects in many categories with relationships is difficult to
understand,’” and that “[w]hile moving objects between layers or
rearranging layers may take longer using the manual method, a patent that
automate[s] pen and paper methodologies to conserve human resources and
minimize errors is a ‘quintessential do it on a computer patent’ directed to an
abstract idea” (quoting Univ. of Fla. Rsch. Found., Inc. v. Gen. Elec. Co.,
916 F.3d 1363, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted))).
Moreover, as previously explained (supra), claim 1 does not require
any particular type of analysis, calculations, or processes that cannot be
performed by the human mind, with pencil and paper as an aid. In short,
claim 1 recites mental processes, which are abstract ideas. We are not
persuaded by Appellant’s arguments that the claim does not recite abstract
mental processes. See MPEP §§ 2106.04(a)(2)(III)(C),
2106.04(a)(2)(III)(B); 2019 Revised Guidance, 84 Fed. Reg. 50, 52 n.14
(Jan. 7, 2019) (“If a claim, under its broadest reasonable interpretation,
covers performance in the mind but for the recitation of generic computer
components, then it is still in the mental processes category unless the claim
cannot practically be performed in the mind.”); October 2019 Update:
Subject Matter Eligibility 9, available at https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/
files/documents/peg_oct_2019_update.pdf (hereinafter “October 2019

Appeal 2024-001413
Application 16/860,594

13
Update”) (“The use of a physical aid (i.e., the pen and paper) to help perform
a mental step (e.g., a mathematical calculation) does not negate the mental
nature of this limitation.”).
In summary, the relevant delineated operations in claim 1 fall within
the grouping of mental processes, which are abstract ideas. See MPEP
§ 2106.04(a)(2)(III). We conclude Appellant’s claim 1 recites a judicial
exception (USPTO Step 2A, Prong 1) because claim 1 recites mental
processes—i.e., determining a duty parameter that represents a flow rate
fraction (a proportion of the period of time during which the flow rate is
above a crossover flow rate).
Step 2A, Prong 2: Is the Judicial Exception Integrated
into a Practical Application?
Having determined that claim 1 recites abstract ideas, we next
determine, under USPTO Step 2A, Prong 2 of the 2019 Revised Guidance,
whether claim 1 is directed to those abstract ideas, or whether the claim
integrates the abstract ideas into a practical application. See MPEP
§ 2106.04(d). Specifically, we consider any additional elements recited in
the claim along with the limitations that recite an abstract idea to determine
whether the claim integrates the abstract ideas into a practical application.
See MPEP § 2106.04(d)(III); October 2019 Update 12.
Claim 1 recites additional elements, including a “blood pump” and “a
control circuit.” Appeal Br. 13 (Claims App.). The functionality of these
additional elements is generally described in Appellant’s Specification, but
neither the claims, nor the Specification describe in detail the technical
features (sensors, computer hardware, and/or software) of these additional
elements that are relevant to claim 1. See Spec. ¶¶ 35–44, 50–63; Figs. 1–3.

Appeal 2024-001413
Application 16/860,594

14
Indeed, Appellant’s Specification explains that the control circuit may
comprise a “general-purpose processor” (Spec. ¶ 38) that is “well-known”—
“processor 210 may be any well-known processor, such as commercially
available processors” (Spec. ¶ 39).
The Examiner determines that claim 1 recites additional elements but
these elements do not integrate the abstract idea into a practical application
because they amount to pre-solution data gathering and generic computing
elements or components that are recited at a high-level of generality, amount
to mere instructions to implement the judicial exception (abstract idea) on a
computer, and merely use a computer (i.e., the additional elements) as a tool
to perform an abstract idea. See Ans. 9–10; MPEP § 2106.05(f).
Appellant contends that claim 1 “achieves the practical application of
generating a suction detect signal.” Reply Br. 5. Appellant further contends
that, similar to other Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“Board”) cases finding
integration into a practical application, claim 1 “‘addresses a need’ in the
field” (“detecting suction conditions in blood pumps”) “by its use of a new
‘duty parameter representing a proportion of the period of time during which
the flow rate is above a crossover flow rate,’ which had not previously been
used, and ‘presents functional and palpable applications in the field.’” Id.
Appellant argues that “the duty parameter of claim 1 may be used to more
accurately identify suction conditions in blood pumps,” and claim 1,
therefore, “is ‘focused on a specific articulated improvement’ in the field of
detecting adverse cardiac events,” and is “not directed to an abstract idea for

Appeal 2024-001413
Application 16/860,594

15
at least the same reasons as the claims in CardioNet.” Reply Br. 5 (citing
prior Board cases).7
We find Appellant’s argument concerning integration of the abstract
ideas into a practical application to be unpersuasive of Examiner error. With
respect to the Board cases cited by Appellant, we note that these decisions
are not controlling law, and we determine that Appellant’s claim 1 is
distinguishable from the claims in these decisions. Specifically, Appellant’s
claim 1 is not directed to the solution of a technical problem, nor is it
directed to an improvement in computer functionality. Instead, claim 1
implements the abstract idea (monitoring blood flow, determining a duty
parameter, and generating an output (a suction detect signal, which is extrasolution (post-solution) activity)) through the use of conventional devices
(e.g., using a generic processor), without providing any technological
solution or improvement. Instead, any “improvement” or “solution” resides
in the abstract idea itself. As explicitly explained by Appellant, it is the
“duty parameter” and the determining operation that provide the purported
improvement. See Reply Br. 5.
Appellant’s claim broadly describes using “generic” computing
components, i.e., the control circuit, to perform the delineated process
operations. Implementing the abstract idea using generic computer elements
does not integrate the abstract idea into a practical application. Ans. 9–10.
Providing “simply generic descriptions of well-known computer
components” does not integrate the abstract idea into a practical application.

In summary, “the focus of the claims is not on such an improvement
in computers as tools, but on certain independently abstract ideas that use
computers as tools.” Elec. Power Grp., 830 F.3d at 1354; see also MPEP
§ 2106.05(f) (emphasis omitted) (instructing examiners to consider
“[w]hether the claim invokes computers or other machinery merely as a tool
to perform an existing process” in determining whether the claim recites
mere instructions to apply the exception). For these reasons, we determine
that claim 1 is not directed to a specific asserted improvement in computer
technology or otherwise integrated into a practical application. See MPEP
§§ 2106.05(a)–(c), (e), (f). Consequently, we conclude that claim 1 is
“directed to” a judicial exception.

Step 2B – Does the Claim Include an “Inventive Concept”
or “Significantly More”?
Having concluded claim 1 is directed to an abstract idea under the
2019 Revised Guidance (USPTO Step 2A analysis), we consider whether
claim 1 has an inventive concept, that is, whether the claim has additional
elements that “‘transform the nature of the claim’ into a patent-eligible
application.” Alice, 573 U.S. at 217 (quoting Mayo, 566 U.S. at 78, 79). We
determine “whether a claim recites significantly more than a judicial
exception,” which requires us to evaluate whether “the additional element
(or combination of elements)” add “a specific limitation other than what is
well-understood, routine and conventional in the field” or simply append
“well-understood, routine, conventional activities previously known to the
industry,” specified “at a high level of generality.” MPEP § 2106.05(d).
The Examiner concludes that claim 1 “do[es] not include additional
elements that are sufficient to amount to significantly more than the judicial
exception,” and the additional elements are well-understood, routine,
conventional. Ans. 10.
Appellant generally contends that claim 1 embodies an inventive
concept, in that “[t]he elements of claim 1 improve[] the technical field at
least because the method utilizes a control circuit to facilitate determinations
of a suction condition in a blood pump” and, therefore, claim 1 “amounts to
significantly more than an alleged abstract idea and represents a patenteligible inventive concept.” Reply Br. 6.
Appellant does not persuade us of Examiner error with respect to the
“inventive concept” analysis. In particular, Appellant does not specifically
discuss how or why claim 1 embodies an inventive concept such that the

18
additional elements amount to more than the judicial exception—i.e., the
additional elements are not well-understood, routine, conventional.
We agree with the Examiner’s conclusion that the additional elements
do not provide an inventive concept. See Ans. 10. Based on our analysis
concerning integration into a practical application (supra), we further find
that additional elements are well-understood, routine, and conventional
computer components and functions. As discussed above with respect to
USPTO Step 2A, Prong 2, the Specification describes the additional
elements—the control circuit—in such broad terms so as to essentially
define them as generic computer components performing generic
instructions. Accordingly, the Specification itself describes the additional
elements as being well-understood, routine, and conventional computing
devices that perform standard computing processes. See, e.g., Spec. ¶¶ 38–
39. Such conventional processes operating on conventional computer
hardware “do not alone transform an otherwise abstract idea into patenteligible subject matter.” FairWarning IP, 839 F.3d at 1096.
Thus, because claim 1 is directed to a judicial exception, without
significantly more, we sustain the Examiner’s rejection under 35 U.S.C.
§ 101 of independent claim 1, as well as claims 2–9 and 21 not separately
argued with particularity (supra).
CONCLUSION
Appellant has not shown that the Examiner erred in rejecting claims
1–9 and 21 as being directed to patent-ineligible subject matter under
35 U.S.C. § 101. We, therefore, sustain the Examiner’s subject matter
eligibility rejection of claims 1–9 and 21. Appellant has shown that the
Examiner erred in rejecting claims 1–18, 20, and 21 as being anticipated

under 35 U.S.C. § 102. We, therefore, do not sustain the Examiner’s
anticipation rejection of claims 1–18, 20, and 21.
