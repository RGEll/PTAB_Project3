CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The invention is directed to solar-reflective and color-changing
composition, for example for use with playground equipment. Spec. ¶ 3.
According to the Specification, the composition reflects sunlight to provide a
cooler surface and changes color at a predefined temperature to provide a
visible warning to avoid possible burns. Id. ¶ 17. Claims 4 and 11,
reproduced below, illustrate the claimed subject matter:
4. A composition of matter, comprising:
a solar-reflective pigment comprising:
zinc oxide, wherein the zinc oxide is between
approximately five percent by weight (~5wt%) and
approximately twenty-five percent by weight (~25wt%) of the
composition of matter;
titanium dioxide, wherein the titanium dioxide is
between approximately seven percent by weight (~7wt%) and
approximately fifteen percent by weight (~15wt%) of the
composition of matter; and
an IR-reflective pigment that prevents the
composition of matter from being white, wherein the IRreflective pigment is between approximately two percent by
weight (~2wt%) and approximately twelve percent by weight
(~12wt%) of the composition of matter;
a thermochromic pigment having a material property of
changing from a first color to a second color when above a
threshold temperature, the first color being visibly different
than the second color, the thermochromic pigment further
changing from the second color to the first color when below
the threshold temperature, wherein the thermochromic pigment
is between approximately two percent by weight (~2wt%) and
approximately ten percent by weight (~10wt%) of the
composition of matter; and
a base being a remaining weight percent portion of the
composition of matter.
11. A composition of matter, comprising:

Appeal 2025-000088

a solar-reflective pigment comprising:
zinc oxide, wherein the zinc oxide is
approximately 6.45 weight percent (~6.45wt%) of the
composition of matter;
titanium dioxide, wherein the titanium dioxide is
~8.06wt% of the composition of matter; and
an IR-reflective pigment that prevents the
composition of matter from being white, wherein the IRreflective pigment is ~2.42wt% of the composition of matter;
a thermochromic pigment having a material property of
changing from a first color to a second color when above a
threshold temperature, the first color being visibly different
than the second color, the thermochromic pigment further
changing from the second color to the first color when below
the threshold temperature, wherein the thermochromic pigment
is ~2.42wt% of the composition of matter; and
a base, wherein the base is ~80.65wt% of the
composition of matter.

OPINION
We review appealed rejections for reversible error based on the
arguments and evidence Appellant provides for each issue Appellant
identifies. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(1)(iv) (2022); Ex parte Frye, 94 USPQ2d
1072, 1075 (BPAI 2010) (precedential) (cited with approval in In re Jung,
637 F.3d 1356, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (“[I]t has long been the Board’s
practice to require an applicant to identify the alleged error in the examiner’s
rejections.”)). “After evidence or argument is submitted by the applicant in
response, patentability is determined on the totality of the record, by a
preponderance of evidence with due consideration to persuasiveness of
argument.” In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
Initially, Appellant presents arguments with respect to claims 4
and 11, asserting that the remaining claims stand or fall together with

the first rejection, and claims 21–23 under the second rejection.

claims 4 and 11. Appeal Br. 13–30. Appellant does not advance any
additional arguments for the separate rejections of dependent claims, instead
they assert that the separately rejected dependent claims are patentable for
the same reasons. Id. at 30. Accordingly, we focus our discussion on
representative independent claims 4 and 11. Any claim not separately
argued will stand or fall with its respective independent claim. See 37
C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(1)(iv).
Claim 4 — Shin/Ryan
The Examiner’s rejection of claim 4 over Shin and Ryan is set forth
on pages 4–6 and of the Non-Final Action. The Examiner finds that Shin
teaches a temperature-sensitive color change composition comprising 8–
10% by weight zinc oxide, 10–15% by weight titanium oxide, and 10–22%
by weight thermochromic pigment, in a base, which overlaps at least some
portion of the recited ranges for these elements. Non-Final Act. 4; Ans. 5.
The Examiner finds that Shin does not teach an IR-reflective pigment or the
claimed amount thereof. Non-Final Act. 4–5; Ans. 6. The Examiner finds
that Ryan teaches IR-reflecting pigments that can be used in compositions to
prevent the color from being white and to reduce the temperature of colored
materials relative to standard pigments. Non-Final Act. 5–6 (citing Ryan 3);
Ans. 6. The Examiner finds that the amount of IR-reflecting pigment is a
result effective variable that determines the total solar reflectance (TSR) of
the composition, and thus one skilled in the art would have determined an
optimum amount via routine experimentation. Non-Final Act. 5 (citing, e.g.,
Ryan 6, Figs. 6, 9); Ans. 7. Thus, the Examiner concludes that it would have
been obvious to a skilled artisan to modify the composition of Shin to
include IR-reflective pigments to prevent the composition from being a

Appeal 2025-000088
Application 17/349,995
6
white color, and that it would result in reducing the temperature of colored
materials relative to standard pigments. Non-Final Act. 5–6; Ans. 7.
Appellant argues that Shin fails to establish that the claimed
ingredients “are result effective variables for temperature mitigation,
friction, or impact resistance,” which are the particularly alleged inventive
effects set forth by Appellant in the Specification. Appeal Br. 21. Appellant
also argues that the Examiner has not established that the claimed ranges are
prima facie obvious over the prior art. In particular, Appellant argues that,
although Ryan teaches a relationship between TSR and temperature
differences and “Ryan teaches that TSR affects temperature,” but “Ryan
does not teach that wt% of ingredients affect temperature.” Appeal Br. 19.
According to Appellant, Ryan does not teach the direct relationship between
the amount of ingredients and temperature.
Appellant’s arguments are not persuasive of Examiner error. With
respect to the recited ranges for the amounts of zinc oxide, titanium oxide
and thermochromic pigment, the Examiner has found that Shin teaches
overlapping or very close ranges. The Examiner is correct that one of
ordinary skill would expect similar properties and similarly successful
outcomes where the ranges touch or overlap. Titanium Metals Corp. of Am.
v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775, 783 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (holding that a prima facie
case of obviousness exists even when the “proportions [of metal content in
alloys are] so close that prima facie one skilled in the art would have
expected them to have the same properties”); In re Peterson, 315 F.3d 1325,
1330 (Fed Cir. 2003) (“[T]he existence of overlapping or encompassing
ranges shifts the burden to the applicant to show that his invention would not
have been obvious.”).

Appeal 2025-000088
Application 17/349,995
7
With respect to the IR-reflective pigment, the Examiner found that
Ryan teaches that the amount of IR-reflective pigment in a composition
directly affects the TSR. This fact supported by the teachings of Ryan. In
particular, as noted by the Examiner, Figure 6 of Ryan demonstrates a direct
correlation between IR-reflective pigment and TSR. See Ryan 4, second full
paragraph (“Figure 6 examines the relationship between pigment loading for
the two IR black pigments over different substrates. The TSR measurements
for the PBr29 and PBk32 were plotted on the vertical axis versus the
[pigment to binder] ratio for each along the horizontal axis. . . . TSR can be
maximized by optimizing pigment loading for visual and IR opacity.”),
Fig. 6.
Accordingly, the skilled artisan would have been capable of adjusting
the amount of IR-reflective pigment to obtain any desired amount of TSR,
including a TSR that would occur when the IR-reflective pigment falls
within the particularly claimed range. In re Geisler, 116 F.3d 1465, 1470
(Fed. Cir. 1997) (“[I]t is not inventive to discover the optimum or workable
ranges by routine experimentation.” (quoting In re Aller, 220 F.2d 454, 456,
105 USPQ 233, 235 (CCPA 1955))); Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d
1348, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding discovery of an optimum value of a
variable in a known process is usually obvious). The Examiner’s reasoning
is sound and sufficient to establish that the recited amount of IR-reflective
pigment would have been prima facie obvious.
Because the amounts would have been prima facie obvious, it is of no
moment that the art does not teach identifying workable or optimal amounts
for the exact same purpose as did the inventors. KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex
Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 420 (2007) (“[A]ny need or problem known in the field

Appeal 2025-000088
Application 17/349,995
8
of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent can provide
a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed.”); see also In re
Kemps, 97 F.3d 1427, 1430, (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding the reason to modify a
reference “does not have to be identical to that of the applicant to establish
obviousness”); In re Beattie, 974 F.2d 1309, 1312, (Fed. Cir. 1992) (“As
long as some motivation or suggestion to combine the references is provided
by the prior art taken as a whole, the law does not require that the references
be combined for the reasons contemplated by the inventor.”).
In light of the strong prima facie case, Appellant has the burden to
show secondary considerations such as unexpected results or criticality to
demonstrate nonobviousness. See In re Huang, 100 F.3d 135, 139, 40
USPQ2d 1685, 1688 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (“This court and its predecessors have
long held, however, that even though applicant’s modification results in
great improvement and utility over the prior art, it may still not be patentable
if the modification was within the capabilities of one skilled in the art, unless
the claimed ranges ‘produce a new and unexpected result which is different
in kind and not merely in degree from the results of the prior art.’”) (quoting
Aller, 220 F.2d at 456; citing In re Woodruff, 919 F.2d 1575, 1578 (Fed. Cir.
1990)).
In this regard, Appellant argues that the claims are nonobvious in light
of the experimental findings in the Specification, further supported by six
different Declarations. Appeal Br. 23–30. Appellant contends that the
claimed invention demonstrates unexpected results, which were contrary to
accepted and conventional wisdom, and which were not predictable. Id.
Appellant argues that such results show significant and practical advantages
that are unrecognized in the prior art. Id. We are not persuaded that the data

Appeal 2025-000088
Application 17/349,995
9
submitted by Appellant, both in the Specification and in the Declarations
(which are substantially identical) are sufficient to establish that the ranges
recited in the claims demonstrate unexpected results that would render the
claimed ranges nonobvious to a skilled artisan. We discuss the data in detail
below.
Appellant’s declarations and the Specification report that three
properties of the claimed composition are “contrary to accepted wisdom” or
different than what “one would expect.” See Declarations3 ¶¶ 24, 26, 28, 30,
32, 35, 44, 55. However, none of these assertions are supported by factual
evidence. We have no evidentiary basis for giving substantial weight to
Appellant’s position as to what a skilled artisan would have expected or
what is “accepted wisdom.” “The Board has broad discretion as to the
weight to give to declarations offered in the course of prosecution.” In re
Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech Ctr., 367 F.3d 1359, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2004). “[T]he
Board is entitled to weigh the declarations and conclude that the lack of
factual corroboration warrants discounting the opinions expressed in the
declarations.” Id. Indeed, a lack of factual support for expert opinion on
factual determinations may render the testimony of little probative value in a
patentability determination. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Delta Resins &
Refractories, Inc., 776 F.2d 281, 294 (Fed. Cir. 1985); see also Velander v.
Garner, 348 F.3d 1359, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (“In giving more weight to
prior publications than to subsequent conclusory statements by experts, the
Board acted well within [its] discretion.”).

3 As the declarations are substantially identical, we cite to paragraph
numbering of the Declaration of Clare H. Han, executed June 16, 2023, who
is a named inventor, as representative.

Appeal 2025-000088
Application 17/349,995
10
Moreover, without being able to ascertain what is expected, Appellant
has not demonstrated that the results are different in kind, rather than merely
degree from those expectations. Optimization, by definition, is determining
the best and most favorable results within the teachings of the prior art.
With respect to unexpected heat mitigating effects, Appellant
contends that it is unexpected that “simply adding more zinc oxide, titanium
dioxide, or IR-reflective pigments is counterproductive to heat-mitigating
effects.” Declaration ¶ 30. Appellants identify that, through
experimentation, they discovered “a somewhat-unpredictable sweet spot” or
“best mode” for heat protection and solar reflectivity, as determined by
surface temperature measurements. Declaration ¶¶ 31, 42. Appellant’s
identify a lack of direct correlation between concentration of materials and
surface temperature readings as conferring patentability of the recited ranges
of materials due to unpredictability. Declaration ¶¶ 35, 36, 40, 41.
Because properties normally vary to some degree with the amounts of
the various materials used in a formulation, that one formulation has a
property somewhat “superior” in comparison to somewhat varied
formulations does not necessarily mean the result would have been
unexpected. An appellant must establish that the property would have been
viewed as unexpected by one of ordinary skill in the art. See Pfizer, 480
F.3d at 1371 (“[A]ny superior property must be unexpected to be considered
as evidence of non-obviousness,” and a proper evaluation considers what
properties were expected.). As noted above, we have no basis for finding it
unexpected that a material could be optimized for various purposes. Thus,
we find Appellant’s test data to be little more than establishing workable or
optimal ranges via routine experimentation consistent with the prior art.

Appeal 2025-000088
Application 17/349,995
11
Nor do we consider the data itself to be particularly compelling for the
reasons primarily set forth by the Examiner. Ans. 14–18. Appellant initially
shows that a formulation having 2.91 wt% IR-reflective blue pigment
measured a lower surface temperature than a formulation having 9.1 wt%
IR-reflective blue pigment (triple the amount). Declaration ¶¶ 34, 36.
However, Appellant does not attest to what the other components of these
formulation are, whether they are within or outside of the ranges taught by
the prior art, and whether they are consistent for both formulations.
Comparative examples must be truly comparative. In re Dunn, 349 F.2d
433, 439 (CCPA 1965) (holding a comparison inadequate because the cause
and effect sought to be proven was lost in a welter of unfixed variables.).
Nor is this example sufficient to show criticality of the claimed range, as
both IR-reflective pigments fall within the recited range. “In general, an
applicant may overcome a prima facie case of obviousness by establishing
‘that the [claimed] range is critical, generally by showing that the claimed
range achieves unexpected results relative to the prior art range.’” Peterson,
315 F.3d at 1330 (quoting In re Geisler, 116 F.3d 1465, 1469–70). The
showing must be commensurate in scope with the claimed range or, in other
words, an applicant must show that the unexpected result occurs throughout
the entire claimed range. Id.; see also In re Harris, 409 F.3d 1339, 1344
(Fed. Cir. 2005) (“Harris needed to show results covering the scope of the
claimed range”). The showing must also present enough data points within
the prior art range, but outside the claimed range, to establish that the
unexpected property does not occur outside the claimed range. In re Hill,
284 F.2d 955, 958–59 (CCPA 1960). Here, the Specification and the

Appeal 2025-000088
Application 17/349,995
12
Declarations provide too little data to prove unexpected results over the prior
art teachings.
Appellant then shows a second experiment where a formulation
having 7.7 wt% IR-reflective yellow pigment, 7.7 wt% titanium dioxide, 6.1
wt% zinc oxide, and 1.9 wt% thermochromic pigment resulted in a higher
surface temperature than a formulation having 2.4 wt% IR-reflective yellow
pigment, 8.1 wt% titanium dioxide, 6.5 wt% zinc oxide, and 2.4 wt%
thermochromic pigment. Declaration ¶¶ 38, 39. While this example
includes a description of some components of the formulations being
compared (without attesting as to the balance of material in the tested
formulations), the actual amounts of each component listed are altered in
both formulations. Specifically, the amount of IR-reflective yellow pigment
decreased from the first to the second comparative formulations, but the
amounts of titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and thermochromic pigment
increased. Thus, again, it is not clear from the record if there is a
meaningfully difference in results. Dunn, 349 F.2d at 439. Moreover, in the
first example, the amount of thermochromic pigment fell completely outside
of the amounts recited in the claims. Any contribution that the amounts of
non-reflective materials may have played in surface temperature is entirely
unclear on this record.
Appellant then submits evidence comparing the degree of friction
between an “unpainted surface,” presumably although not expressly reported
to be a surface of a playground slide, and a “painted (or coated)” surface.
Declaration ¶¶ 46–53. Appellant demonstrates an increased average
measured force required to slide a fixed weight for two materials (namely
denim and “athletic shorts” material). Declaration ¶¶ 49-51. Appellant

Appeal 2025-000088
Application 17/349,995
13
reported increased measured force for the unpainted surface over the painted
surface. In this case, in which Appellant does not identify the formulation
for the painted surface (nor the material used for the unpainted surface for
clear direct comparison), we have no way to understand if the formulation
falls within or outside of the claimed range or what other contents, and in
what concentrations, the materials of any given “paint,” “coating,” or
“surface” may have or have not contributed to a decrease in friction.
Accordingly, without more information, Appellant’s demonstration of a
difference here is not persuasive that the recited claimed ranges of materials
is not obvious.
Finally, Appellant presents evidence of tested “impact resistance.”
Declaration ¶¶ 56–58. Although the inventors subjected “several of the
coatings” to impact testing, of which the exact components and amounts
thereof have not be identified, “[f]or one of the samples” more panels passed
the impact testing at the highest impact force setting and fewer passed at a
lower impact force setting, which is noted as being surprising. Id. at ¶¶ 5657. The example with the anomalous results, comprised 2.4 wt% IRreflective pigment, 8.1 wt% titanium dioxide, 6.5 wt% zinc oxide, and 2.4
wt% thermochromic pigment (without attesting as to the balance of material
in the tested formulations). Yet, a single example with an allegedly different
result is insufficient to demonstrate non-obviousness, as it is not clearly
compared with formulations outside of the range, within the full scope of the
claims, or different that those taught by the prior art. Peterson, 315 F.3d at
1330.

Accordingly, we agree with the Examiner that claim 4 is not
patentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 based on the combination of Shin and
Ryan.
Claim 4 — Li/Ryan
The Examiner’s rejection of claim 4 over Li and Ryan is set forth on
pages 8–11 and of the Non-Final Action. The Examiner finds that Li
teaches a temperature-sensitive color change composition comprising about
1 to about 30% by weight thermochromic pigment (a temperature sensitive
material) as well as about 1 to about 30% of a stabilizer. Non-Final Act. 9;
Ans. 12. The Examiner finds that the stabilizer may be an “ultraviolet light
stabilizer,” which may comprise “one or more of carbon black (i.e., a weak
IR-reflective pigment), zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide.” Non-Final Act. 9;
Ans. 12. Thus, we agree with the Examiner that the prior art supports a
finding of a composition that overlaps the claimed ranges of a
thermochromic pigment, zinc oxide, titanium oxide and a weak IR-reflective
pigment. The Examiner finds that Li does not teach an amount of IRreflective pigment that “prevents the composition from being [a] white
color” or the claimed amount thereof. Non-Final Act. 9; Ans. 6. Thus, the
Examiner further relies on Ryan in the same way discussed above for the
prior rejection of claim 4. Non-Final Act. 9–11; Ans. 6–8.
Appellant argues that Li fails to establish that the claimed ingredients
“are result effective variables for temperature mitigation, friction, or impact
resistance,” which are the particularly inventive effects set forth by
Appellant in the Specification. Appeal Br. 20. Appellant also argues that
Li’s “thermochromic polymer” is not the same as the recited
“thermochromic pigment.” Appeal Br. 22. Appellant argues that the

Appeal 2025-000088
Application 17/349,995
15
Examiner has not established that the claimed ranges are prima facie obvious
over the prior art. In particular, Appellant argues that “Li never teaches any
range at all (let alone an overlapping range)” for zinc oxide, titanium
dioxide, or an IR-reflective pigment, and that there is “a complete absence of
any range for” these components. Appeal Br. 22–23. Appellant argues that
the carbon black taught by Li is not an IR-reflective pigment. Appeal
Br. 20. In response to which, the Examiner directs us to Figure 2 of Ryan,
which shows that carbon black does have some reflectance (less than about
10%). Ans. 13–14.
Appellant’s arguments are not persuasive of Examiner error. The
Examiner explained that Li teaches temperature sensitive material (pigment)
within a polymer base to form a thermochromic polymer composition. NonFinal 9; Ans. 12; see Li ¶¶ 7, 22. With respect to the recited ranges for the
amounts of zinc oxide, titanium oxide and thermochromic pigment, the
Examiner has found that Li teaches overlapping or very close ranges. NonFinal 9; Ans. 12. We find this supported by the evidence of record that
teaches “one or more of zinc oxide, titanium oxide, and carbon black” in an
amount from about 1 to about 30% by weight. See Li ¶¶ 27, 30, 31, claims
11, 14. A skilled artisan would understand that the prior art encompasses a
formulation that includes all three ingredients and that the amounts of those
ingredient could vary but not such that the total of the three would be less
than 1% or more than 30%. Thus, the individual range for each component
would overlap the recited ranges. The Examiner is correct that one of
ordinary skill would expect similar properties and similarly successful
outcomes where the ranges touch or overlap. Peterson, 315 F.3d at 1330.

Appeal 2025-000088
Application 17/349,995
16
With respect to the IR-reflective pigment, we agree with the Examiner
that carbon black is a weak IR-reflective pigment, and the claims are not
limited to any particular degree of reflectivity for the recited pigment. See
Ryan, Fig. 2. Further, the Examiner relies on the teachings of Ryan for the
IR-reflective pigment. Non-Final Act. 9–11; Ans. 6–8. Appellant’s
arguments with respect to Ryan are the same as those addressed above with
respect to the prior rejection. Appeal Br. 19. Thus, for the same reasons, we
find that the skilled artisan would have been capable of adjusting the amount
of IR-reflective pigment to obtain any desired amount of TSR, including a
TSR that would occur when the IR-reflective pigment falls within the
particularly claimed range. Again, the Examiner’s reasoning is sound and
sufficient to establish that the recited amount of IR-reflective pigment would
have been prima facie obvious.
As with the prior rejection, in light of the strong prima facie case,
Appellant has the burden to show secondary considerations such as
unexpected results or criticality to demonstrate nonobviousness. Appellant
relies on the same reasoning and evidence found unpersuasive of
nonobviousness as discussed in detail above. Appeal Br. 23–30.
Accordingly, we agree with the Examiner that claim 4 is not
patentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 based on the combination of Li and Ryan.
Claim 11 — Li/Ryan
Claim 11 recites a specific amount for each ingredient (as opposed to
a range). For the reasons noted above, the Examiner has found that the more
specific amounts of each ingredient recited in claim 11 are also encompassed
by the broadest ranges taught by Li. Non-Final Act. 11–12; Ans. 5–6.
Thus, the specific amounts recited in claim 11 are prima facie obvious in

view of Li and Ryan for the same reasons as discussed above for claim 4.
Appellants arguments that the amounts taught by the reference are not
specific enough for the narrowly recited amounts (see generally Appeal Br.
22–23; Reply Br. 6–7) do not negate the prima facie case that the amounts
would nonetheless be obvious.
Appellant presents no separate argument regarding unexpected results
for claim 11 from those discussed above for claim 4. Appeal Br. 23–30.
Although claim 11 includes amounts of components similar to some of the
formulations discussed in the Declarations, we are not persuaded that the
Declarations demonstrate criticality or unexpected results with respect to the
particular formulation of claim 11, substantially for the reasons noted above.
Further, the formulations that are similar recite the same amount of IRreflective pigment, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and thermochromic pigment
(see, e.g., Declaration ¶¶ 39, 57), but do not clearly indicate that the
remainder of the formulation was a base, such that it is unclear whether the
formulations relied upon in evidence are commensurate with the scope of
claim 11.
Accordingly, we agree with the Examiner that claim 11 is not
patentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 based on the combination of Li and Ryan.
CONCLUSION
The Examiner’s rejections are AFFIRMED.
