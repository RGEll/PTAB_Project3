DECISION ON APPEAL

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellant1 appeals under 35 U.S.C. § 134(a) from the final rejection
of claims 1–12 and 14–19, which constitute all pending claims on appeal.

1 We use the word “Appellant” to refer to “applicant” as defined in
37 C.F.R. § 1.42 (2021). “The word ‘applicant’ when used in this title refers
to the inventor or all of the joint inventors, or to the person applying for a
patent as provided in §§ 1.43, 1.45, or 1.46.” 37 C.F.R. § 1.42(a). Appellant
identifies William Shatner, Scott C. Harris, and Benjamin J. Kwitek as the
real parties in interest (Appeal Br. 2).

Claim 13 has been canceled (see Amendment filed May 25, 2023, p. 6). We
have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.

DISCLOSED AND CLAIMED INVENTION
Appellant’s disclosed invention, entitled “Smartphone Organization
System and Application” (see Title), pertains to methods and systems of
operating a file system on a portable computing device (e.g., a smartphone).
More particularly, Appellant’s disclosed and claimed invention involves
assisting users in navigating and accessing information and websites
pertaining to a specific location by determining a user is at the specified
location (Spec. ¶¶ 9–12; Abstract; claims 1, 15, 17). Independent claims 1,
15, and 17 are similar in scope and are illustrative of the claimed subject
matter.
Claim 1 is illustrative of the claimed subject matter:2
1. A programmed system for operating on a portable
computing device, comprising:
a portable computing device having a processor, memory,
and display, the memory storing plural files on the computing
device, and the processor programmed to receive an indication
from a user of the portable computing device, that a current file
is an important file among the plural files that are stored on the
computing device;
the processor operating to characterize the current file
according to information about the current file, including

2 Independent claims 1, 15, and 17 recite commensurate subject matter
pertaining to a programmed system for operating on a portable computing
device (claim 1), a method of operating a file system on a portable
computing device (claims 15 and 17) including determining that a user is at
a specified location.

Appeal 2025-002136
Application 17/933,086

characterized information that is determined by the processor to
represent contents of the current file;
the processor operating to indicate the current file is an
important file, and to store the characterized information about
the important file;
wherein there are multiple stored important files,
the processor operating to receive an indication from a
user that they want an important file,
the processor automatically determining a current context
of the portable computing device, the current context including a
location of the computing device, and the processor using the
current context to search the information about the important
files that are stored, and to find at least one match between the
current context of the computing device and the characterized
information about the stored important files, where the at least
one match is returned to the user as the important file,
wherein the processor accesses a global database of
information related to contents of files that have been
characterized by at least one person other than the user when the
at least one person other than the user was at a specified location,
and where [A] the processor determines the user at the
specified location, and uses a file that was characterized by the
at least one person other than the at least one person was at the
specified location, [B] to determine the at least one match by
finding a file that matches the file that has been characterized by
the people other than the user at the specified location.

Appeal Br. 42–43, Claims Appendix (formatting, bracketed material, and
emphases added).
15. A method of operating a file system on a portable
computing device, comprising:
receiving a file on the portable computing device;
receiving an indication from a user of the portable
computing device that the file is to be used later, and responsive
to receiving said indication, characterizing the file according to
characterized information about the file; and storing the file
along with the characterized information about the file as a stored
file;

receiving global information from other at least one other
user, [C] each global information indicating a specified file that
was used by the at least one other user when the at least one other
user was at a specified location;
[D] determining that the user is at the specified location,
responsive to the determining that the user is at the
specified location, [E] using the global information obtained
from the at least one other user to find one of the stored files that
matches to the specified file that was used at the specified
location by another user; and
returning the one stored file to the user responsive to the
user being at the specified location and using the global
information.

Appeal Br. 46–47, Claims Appendix (formatting, bracketed material, and

17. A method of operating a file system on a portable
computing device, comprising:
receiving a file on the portable computing device;
receiving an indication from a user of the portable
computing device that the file is to be used later, and responsive
to receiving said indication, characterizing the file according to
characterized information about the file; and
storing the file along with the characterized information
about the file as a stored file;
wherein there are multiple stored files;
[F] determining that the user is at a first location , and
receiving from the user information about which of the stored
files is relevant to the first location;
[G] using the information about which of the stored files
is relevant to the first location as global information, and [H]
providing the global information to other users who are at the
first location and cannot identify a desired file at the first
location.

REJECTIONS
The Examiner made the following rejections:
(1) The Examiner provisionally rejected claim 15 under the judicially
created doctrine of non-statutory, obviousness-type double patenting over
the combination of Application No. 18/640,926 (claim 11), Akaezuwa (US
2007/0130370 A1; published June 7, 2007), Bauersfeld et al. (US 6,189,024
B1; Feb. 13, 2001), and Yi-Hsuan Yang et al., ContextSeer: Context Search
and Recommendation at Query Time for Shared Consumer Photos, MM, pp.
199–208 (October 26–31, 2008) (hereinafter, “Yang”). Final Act. 8–13;
Ans. 3. Application No. 18/640,926 was abandoned on June 18, 2025, for a
failure to respond to the Non-Final Office Action mailed November 19,
2024, in that application. In addition, a Terminal Disclaimer was filed and
approved in the instant application on November 25, 2024.
Because Application No. 18/640,926 has been abandoned, there is no
evidence before us (thus, no prima facie case of obviousness) to support the
provisional double patenting rejection before us. In view of the foregoing,
we sua sponte reverse the provisional double patenting rejection for a failure
to present a prima facie case, and we will not discuss this rejection further,
other than to include it in our conclusion.
(2) The Examiner rejected claims 1–12 and 14–19 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 101 as being directed to patent-ineligible subject matter (an abstract idea,
e.g., a mental process), without significantly more. Final Act. 13–15; Ans.
3–9.

(3) The Examiner rejected claims 1, 2, 14, 15, and 17 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103 as being unpatentable over Akaezuwa, Bauersfeld, and Yang. Final
Act. 19–29.
(4) The Examiner rejected claims 3 and 4 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as
being unpatentable over the combination of Akaezuwa, Bauersfeld, Yang,
and Chien-Chih Yu et al., Personalized Location-Based Recommendation
Services for Tour Planning in Mobile Tourism Applications, EC-WEB, pp.
38–49 (2009) (hereinafter, “Yu”). Final Act. 29–31.
(5) The Examiner rejected claim 5 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being
unpatentable over the combination of Akaezuwa, Bauersfeld, Yang, and
Chapman et al. (US 2006/0053010 A1; published March 9, 2006)
(hereinafter, “Chapman”). Final Act. 31–32.
(6) The Examiner rejected claims 6–10 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as
being unpatentable over the combination of Akaezuwa, Bauersfeld, Yang,
and Mundinger et al. (US 2010/0228574 A1; Sept. 9, 2010) (hereinafter,
“Mundinger”). Final Act. 32–35.
(7) The Examiner rejected claim 11 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being
unpatentable over the combination of Akaezuwa, Bauersfeld, Yang, and
Toyoshima (US 2014/0184607 A1; published July 3, 2014). Final Act. 36.
(8) The Examiner rejected claim 12 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being
unpatentable over the combination of Akaezuwa, Bauersfeld, Yang, and
Chapman. Final Act. 36–37.
(9) The Examiner rejected claims 16, 18, and 19 under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103 as being unpatentable over the combination of Akaezuwa, Bauersfeld,
Yang, and Zhang et al., A Financial Ticket Image Intelligent Recognition

System Based on Deep Learning, KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS 222, pp. 1–
14 (March 23, 2021) (hereinafter, “Zhang”). Final Act. 37–40.
In formulating the rejections, the Examiner relies on the base
combination of Akaezuwa, Bauersfeld, and Yang, and in particular Yang
individually, as teaching or suggesting the location features of claims 1
(limitations A and B), 15 (limitations C, D, and E), and 17 (limitations F, G,
and H) (see e.g., Final Act. 21 (claim 1), 26–27 (claim 15), 29 (claim 17);
Ans. 11–15).

ISSUES
Based on Appellant’s arguments in the Appeal Brief (Appeal Br. 12–
41), the following principal issues are presented on appeal:
(1) Did the Examiner err in rejecting claims 1–12 and 14–19 as being
directed to patent-ineligible subject matter (an abstract idea, e.g., a mental
process), without significantly more?3
(2) Did the Examiner err in rejecting claims 1–12 and 14–19 under
35 U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over the base combination of
Akaezuwa, Bauersfeld, and Yang, because Yang, and thus the base
combination, fails to teach or suggest determining the specific location of a
user and providing files/information to other users about that location, as

3 Based on Appellant’s arguments (see Appeal Br. 12–15), which only
address independent claim 1 on the merits, and rely on those arguments for
the eligibility of remaining independent claims 15 and 17, we select claim 1
as representative of claims 1–12 and 14–19 rejected as being directed to
patent-ineligible subject matter, without significantly more. See 37 C.F.R.
§ 41.37(c)(1)(iv).

recited in independent claim 1, and as commensurately recited in remaining
independent claims 15 and 17?

ANALYSIS
Issue (1): Eligibility
Principles of Law
Patent eligibility under § 101 is a question of law that may contain
underlying issues of fact. “We review the [Examiner’s] ultimate conclusion
on patent eligibility de novo.” Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc., 896
F.3d 1335, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d
1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018)); see also SiRF Tech., Inc. v. Int’l Trade
Comm’n, 601 F.3d 1319, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (“Whether a claim is drawn
to patent-eligible subject matter is an issue of law that we review de novo.”).
We have reviewed the rejections of claims 1, 3–8, 10–15, and 17–22
in light of Appellant’s arguments. We adopt as our own the determinations
and reasons set forth in the rejection from which this appeal is taken (see
Final Act. 13–18) and in the Examiner’s Answer (see Ans. 3–9), to the
extent consistent with our analysis below. We provide the following
explanation to highlight and address specific arguments and determinations
primarily for emphasis.
United States Patent and Trademark Office Guidance
on 35 U.S.C. § 101 and MPEP Eligibility Guidance
An invention is patent-eligible if it claims a “new and useful process,
machine, manufacture, or composition of matter.” See 35 U.S.C. § 101.4

statutory categories of invention, i.e., a process, machine, manufacture, or

The Supreme Court, however, has long interpreted 35 U.S.C. § 101 to
include implicit exceptions: “‘[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and
abstract ideas’ are not patentable.” Mayo Collaborative Servs. v.
Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 70 (2012) (quoting Diamond v. Diehr,
450 U.S. 175, 185 (1981)).
In January and October of 2019, the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office (“USPTO”) published revised guidance on the application of
35 U.S.C. § 101. See 2019 Revised Patent Subject Matter Eligibility
Guidance, 84 Fed. Reg. 50 (Jan. 7, 2019) (“2019 Revised Guidance”) and
USPTO, October 2019 Update: Subject Matter Eligibility (the “October
2019 Update”). “All USPTO personnel are, as a matter of internal agency
management, expected to follow the guidance.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 51; October
2019 Update at 1. We, therefore, refer to the MPEP for the Eligibility
Guidance originally published in the Federal Register, particularly within
Sections 2103 through 2106.07(c).
Under MPEP § 2106, we first look to whether the claim recites:
(1) any judicial exceptions, including certain groupings of abstract
ideas (i.e., mathematical concepts, certain methods of organizing
human activity such as a fundamental economic practice, or
mental processes) (“Step 2A, Prong One”); and
(2) additional elements that integrate the judicial exception into a
practical application (“Step 2A, Prong Two”).5

composition of matter, is referred to as “Step 1” in the patent-eligibility
inquiry under 35 U.S.C. § 101.
5 “Examiners evaluate integration into a practical application by: (1)
identifying whether there are any additional elements recited in the claim
beyond the judicial exception(s); and (2) evaluating those additional
elements individually and in combination to determine whether they
integrate the exception into a practical application.” MPEP § 2106.04(d)(II).

Category of Invention—Step 1
We first determine whether the claim falls within a statutory category
of invention. Representative claim 1 is a system or apparatus claim. As a
machine or manufacture, claim 1 falls within one of the broad statutory
categories of patent-eligible subject matter listed in 35 U.S.C. § 101.
Because the claim falls into one of the statutory categories of patent-eligible
subject matter, we proceed to Step 2A, Prong One, of the USPTO Eligibility
Guidance, to determine whether the claim recites a judicial exception to
patent eligibility.
Reciting a Judicial Exception – Step 2A, Prong One
Under Step 2A, Prong One, we first look to whether the claim recites
any judicial exceptions, including certain groupings of abstract ideas (i.e.,
mathematical concepts, certain methods of organizing human activity such
as a fundamental economic practice, or mental processes. MPEP § 2106.04.
The Examiner concludes (see Final Act. 13–14; Ans. 3–4), and we agree,
that the system recited in independent claim 1 includes, inter alia, the steps
of (i) characterizing a current file according to information about the file; (ii)
indicating a file is important; (iii) determining a context including a location
for the portable computing device; (iv) determining the user is at a specified
location; and (v) determining a match for the file, which are all mental
processes.
The Examiner concludes that the claims recite a judicially excepted
abstract idea, specifically mental processes like searching, matching,
determining, and characterizing (see Final Act. 13–14; Ans. 3–4). Such

Appeal 2025-002136
Application 17/933,086

11
functions include observation, evaluation, judgment, opinion which could be
performed in the human mind and/or with pen and paper.
The claimed method is thus similar to other broadly worded methods
that courts have determined are directed to mental processes. See, e.g.,
Synopsys, Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp., 839 F.3d 1138, 1146–52 (Fed. Cir.
2016); Elec. Power Grp., LLC v. Alstom S.A., 830 F.3d 1350, 1353–56 (Fed.
Cir. 2016); Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Symantec Corp., 838 F.3d 1307,
1316–19 (Fed. Cir. 2016); In re BRCA1- & BRCA2-Based Hereditary
Cancer Test Patent Litig., 774 F.3d 755, 761–65 (Fed. Cir. 2014);
CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions, Inc., 654 F.3d 1366, 1370–77 (Fed.
Cir. 2011); cf. Cisco Sys., Inc. v. Uniloc 2017 LLC, No. 2019-2048, 2020
WL 2465483, at *2–3 (Fed. Cir. May 13, 2020). Simply put, the recited
steps “involve making determinations and identifications, which are mental
tasks humans routinely do.” In re Killian, 45 F.4th 1373, 1379 (Fed. Cir.
2022) (citation omitted).
We also note that the steps of receiving an indication from a user that
a current file is important, receiving an indication from a user that they want
an important file, returning a match to a user, and accessing a global
database of information are directed to extra-solution activities.6
Appellant contends that the Examiner errs because the specific
language of claim 1 (i) “precludes the match being a mental observation”
(Appeal Br. 12); (ii) “specifically requires that the processor … finds the at
least one match” (Appeal Br. 13); (iii) “requires a number of items be done
by a computer” (Appeal Br. 14); and (iv) “specifically require[s] file

6 See MPEP § 2106.05(g). This point is also relevant to the next step of
analysis in Step 2A, Prong Two, as discussed below.

Appeal 2025-002136
Application 17/933,086

12
operations of the computer, finding a file and returning that file” (Appeal Br.
14). However, this is not persuasive, as the portable computing device,
processor, memory, and global database are merely generic computer
elements used as a tool to perform the mental processes.
“[T]he inability for the human mind to perform each claim step does
not alone confer patentability.” FairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Sys., 839
F.3d 1089, 1098 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Consequently, even assuming that only a
computerized system can perform the steps/functions of claim 1, Appellant’s
argument is unpersuasive; the portable computing device’s data reception and
manipulation function alone does not make claim 1 any less abstract.
To be sure, reciting the use of conventional components which
function in their expected manner, however, is insufficient to satisfy section
101. See Uniloc USA, Inc. v. LG Elecs. USA, Inc., 957 F.3d 1303, 1306
(Fed. Cir. 2020) (explaining that the eligibility “inquiry often turns on
whether the claims focus on specific asserted improvements in computer
capabilities or instead on a process or system that qualifies [as] an abstract
idea for which computers are invoked merely as a tool”); BSG Tech LLC v.
BuySeasons, Inc., 899 F.3d 1281, 1290–91 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (“If a claim’s
only ‘inventive concept’ is the application of an abstract idea using
conventional and well understood techniques, the claim has not been
transformed into a patent-eligible application of an abstract idea.”).
In summary, we agree with the Examiner’s conclusion that claim 1
recites a judicially excepted abstract idea. We proceed to Step 2A, Prong
Two of the eligibility analysis.

Appeal 2025-002136
Application 17/933,086

13
Integrated Into a Practical Application – Step 2A, Prong Two
Having identified that claim 1 recites a judicially excepted abstract
idea, we next evaluate whether the claim integrates the identified abstract
idea (e.g., mental processes) into a practical application. See MPEP
§ 2106.04(d). We consider whether there are any additional elements
beyond the abstract ideas that, individually or in combination, integrate the
abstract ideas into a practical application, using one or more of the
considerations laid out by the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit. Id.;
see also Mayo, 566 U.S. at 80.
Courts have found limitations indicative that an additional element
may have integrated an additional element into a practical application to
include: “[a]n improvement in the functioning of a computer, or an
improvement to other technology or technical field”; “[a]pplying or using a
judicial exception to effect a particular treatment . . . for a disease or medical
condition”; “[i]mplementing a judicial exception with . . . a particular
machine or manufacture that is integral to the claim”; “[e]ffecting a
transformation or reduction of a particular article to a different state or
thing”; or “[a]pplying or using the judicial exception in some other
meaningful way beyond generally linking the use of the judicial exception to
a particular technological environment.” MPEP §§ 2106.04(d),
2106.04(d)(1), 2106.04(d)(2), 2106.05(b), 2106.05(c), 2106.05(e).
The Examiner determines, and we agree, that claim 1 contains the
additional elements of a portable computing device, a processor, a memory,

Appeal 2025-002136
Application 17/933,086

14
and a display (see Final Act. 14). Claim 1 also recites a further additional
element, such as a global database.
Appellant’s contention (see Appeal Br. 15–16) that claim 1 recites a
better way to find and return a file is unpersuasive that any additional
element or combination of elements integrate the mental processes into a
practical application. As discussed supra, however, we regard such
limitations as amounting to necessary data gathering and outputting. Such
insignificant extra-solution activity does not serve to integrate an abstract
idea into a practical application. MPEP § 2106.05(g); see also, e.g., In re
Grams, 888 F.2d 835, 839–40 (Fed. Cir. 1989); CyberSource, 654 F.3d at
1375; Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs. Inc., 566 U.S. 66
(2012).
Additionally, merely adding generic hardware and computer
components to perform abstract ideas does not integrate those ideas into a
practical application. See Alice Corp., 573 U.S. at 223 (The “mere recitation
of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into
a patent-eligible invention.”); McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,
837 F.3d 1299, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (“The abstract idea exception prevents
patenting a result where ‘it matters not by what process or machinery the
result is accomplished.’” (Quoting O’Reilly v. Morse, 56 U.S. 62, 113
(1853)) (emphasis added)).
We disagree with Appellant’s assertions that the recited features of
claim 1 “improve[] the operation of the computer” (Appeal Br. 15), or any
other technology or technical field. See MPEP § 2106.05(a) (citation
omitted). Although claim 1 additionally recites that certain functions are
performed using “a processor” and a “global database,” Appellant presents

Appeal 2025-002136
Application 17/933,086

15
no persuasive evidence that practicing the claim results in an improvement
to the functioning of the computer or any other technology. Appeal Br. 15.
In particular, claim 1 is silent regarding specific limitations describing an
improved processor, memory, database, or display.
As a result, we agree with the Examiner’s determination that claim 1
does not recite additional limitations that integrate the judicial exception into
a practical application (see Ans. 5), and we do not consider representative
claim 1 to recite any element(s), or ordered combination of elements, which
transforms the abstract idea into patent-eligible subject matter.
Inventive Concept – Step 2B
As set forth under MPEP § 2106.05(d), only if a claim (1) recites a
judicial exception, and (2) does not integrate that exception into a practical
application, do we then look, under Step 2B, to whether the claim: (3) adds
a specific limitation beyond the judicial exception that is not “wellunderstood, routine, conventional activity” in the field; or (4) simply
appends well-understood, routine, conventional activities previously known
to the industry, specified at a high level of generality, to the judicial
exception.
The Examiner finds, and we agree, that the additional elements of
clam 1 are well-understood, routine, and conventional (see Final Act. 14–15
citing MPEP § 2106.05(d)(II). Appellant does not dispute this finding with
evidence or argument in the Appeal Brief, and no Reply Brief has been filed.
We agree with the Examiner and observe that, beyond the limitations
describing the abstract idea, claim 1 does not recite any limitations (or
combination of limitations) that are not well-understood, routine, and
conventional. Appellant does not direct our attention to anything in the

Appeal 2025-002136
Application 17/933,086

16
Specification that indicates the computer components perform anything
other than well-understood, routine, and conventional functions. See
buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc., 765 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“That
a computer receives and sends the information over a network—with no
further specification—is not even arguably inventive.”); In re TLI Commc’ns
LLC Patent Litig., 823 F.3d 607, 614 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (server that receives
data, extracts classification information from the received data, and stores
the digital images insufficient to add an inventive concept); Trading Techs.
Int’l, Inc. v. IBG LLC, 921 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (mere
automation of manual processes using generic computers’ . . . ‘does not
constitute a patentable improvement in computer technology (quoting Credit
Acceptance Corp. v. Westlake Servs., 859 F.3d 1044, 1055 (Fed. Cir.
2017))); Alice, 573 U.S. at 225–26 (receiving, storing, sending information
over networks insufficient to add an inventive concept).
Appellant’s Specification describes the claimed technological features
at a generic level. See Fig. 1; Spec. ¶¶ 24–26 (describing a portable
computing device, e.g., handheld phone 100 in no more than generic terms
related to generic components and functions). There is no discussion of any
special functionality or considerations for a technological aspect of any
technological component recited in claim 1.
More generally, Appellant has not identified any additional element
beyond the judicial exception, that is not well-understood, routine, and
conventional, such that the claim amounts to significantly more than a
judicial exception. As discussed supra, we determine that independent
claim 1 recites a plurality of steps capable of being performed in the human

mind or with pencil and paper, in combination with data gathering steps that
constitute insignificant extra-solution activity.
Therefore, because the additional elements of claim 1 recite only wellunderstood, routine, and conventional technology, we conclude under Step
2B that claim 1, viewing its limitations “both individually ‘and as an ordered
combination’,” do not recite significantly more than the judicial exception to
transform the claim into patent-eligible subject matter. See Alice, 573 U.S.
at 217 (quoting Mayo, 566 U.S. at 79).
Eligibility Summary
We affirm the Examiner’s rejection of representative claim 1 under
35 U.S.C. § 101 as being directed to patent-ineligible subject matter. We
also affirm the rejection of claims 2–12 and 14–19 because Appellant does
not provide separate substantive arguments for independent claims 15 and
17 or the remaining dependent claims allowing then to fall with claim 1. See
Appeal Br. 12–15; 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(1)(iv).

Issue (2): Obviousness Rejections
We have reviewed the Examiner’s rejections (see Final Act. 19–40) in
light of Appellant’s arguments that the Examiner has erred (see Appeal Br.
16–40), as well as the Examiner’s response to Appellant’s arguments in the
Appeal Brief (see Ans. 10–16). Appellant’s contentions that the Examiner
has not provided a sufficient mapping of Yang, and in particular Section 1,
paragraph 4 of Yang, to the location determination and file provisioning of
claims 1 (limitations A and B), 15 (limitations C, D, and E), and 17
(limitations F, G, and H) context increment of claims 1, 15, and 17 (see

Appeal 2025-002136
Application 17/933,086

18
Appeal Br. 16–31) are persuasive. We provide the following explanation for
emphasis.
“[R]ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere
conclusory statements; instead, there must be some articulated reasoning
with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of
obviousness.” KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex, 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007); We will
not resort to speculation or assumptions to cure deficiencies in the
Examiner’s fact finding or reasoning. See In re Warner, 379 F.2d 1011,
1017 (CCPA 1967).
In the instant case before us, with regard to the location determination
limitations of claims 1, 15, and 17, the Examiner makes the same generic
finding as to Yang’s Section 1, paragraph 4:
Akaezuwa does not disclose claim element “location of
the computing device”; however, Yang utilizes rich context cues
of shared consumer photos in search, where context cues include
visual features, concept scores, and time/location metadata (i.e.,
characterized information) readily available on location -aware
smart phones (i.e., user device) (Yang: sec. 1, para. 4).

Final Act. 22; see also Final Act. 26 (same findings as to claim 15); Final
Act. 29 (same findings as to claim 17).
Yang’s Section 1, paragraph 4, reads, in whole:
To address these issues, we propose to utilize rich context cues
[citation omitted] of shared consumer photos to improve the
search result and to recommend relevant tags and canonical
images. Generally, the context cues of consumer photos contain
the low -level visual features, (high -level) concept scores, and
time and location metadata [citation omitted], as illustrated in
Fig. 1. Though text-based search model is not perfect, certain
context cues do exist in the retrieved images. Fig. 2 gives an
illustrative example of text -based search result for the query

“eiffel tower. ” While Fig. 2(a) correctly contains the query
object in sight, the remaining ones fail to for noisy text
descriptions (e.g., Fig. 2(b) is actually a picture of Tokyo Tower,
by which Eiffel Tower is usually compared with.) or noisy tags
(e.g., Figs. 2(c}-(e) are the images taken from, underneath and
nearby Eiffel Tower; naturally they are tagged with the keyword
“eiffel tower” by the photo owners.). However, by investigating
the visual content, a search system might be able to learn that the
information needs (or target semantics) of the user is related to
tower-like objects and exclude Figs. 2(c) -2(e) from the search
result. Likewise, Fig. 2(b) can be detected as false positive by
examining the location metadata (i.e., geo tags). Time metadata
can also be important for activity-related queries, such as
“christmas eve” or “oktoberfest.” In other words, via mining the
co-occurrence of context cues, or contextual patterns, we can
uncover rich information that the user is looking for.

Yang p. 200, Section 1, ¶ 4 (underlined emphasis added). Although the
cited portion of Yang discloses examining location metadata or geo tags, this
Section 1, paragraph 4 of Yang is silent as to determining the specific
location of a user and providing files/information to other users about that
location, as recited in independent claim 1 (see claim 1, limitations A and
B), and as commensurately recited in remaining independent claims 15 (see
claim 15, limitations C, D, and E), and 17 (see claim 17, limitations F, G,
and H).
Yang is silent as to determining the specific location of a user and
matching that location to the same location of other users in order to provide
relevant files as set forth in claims 1, 15, and 17, and as described in
Appellant’s Specification. Although the Examiner points generally to
Section 1, paragraph 4 of Yang as teaching location metadata and context
cues that can be matched with photos of a single user (see Final Act. 22
(claim 1), 26 (claim 15), 29 (claim 17)), the Examiner has not sufficiently
