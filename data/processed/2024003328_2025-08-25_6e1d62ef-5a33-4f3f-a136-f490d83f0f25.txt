CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
Claim 1 illustrates the subject matter on appeal, and reads as follows:
1. A non-nicotine cartridge for a non-nicotine e-vaping
device, comprising:
a housing defining a reservoir containing a non-nicotine
pre-vapor formulation;
a wick configured to transport the non-nicotine pre-vapor
formulation by capillary action;
an integral heater-thermocouple configured to heat the
non-nicotine pre-vapor formulation in the wick to generate a
non-nicotine vapor, the integral heater-thermocouple including
a first segment made of a first alloy and a second segment made
of a second alloy, the first segment being downstream from the
second segment;
a first vapor channel; and
a second vapor channel, the first vapor channel and the
second vapor channel spaced apart by the reservoir,
wherein the housing has a first longitudinal axis, and the
integral heater-thermocouple has a second longitudinal axis
that intersects the first longitudinal axis to form an oblique
angle.

Appeal Br. 15–16 (Claims Appendix) (emphasis added).
Independent claim 17 recites a non-nicotine e-vaping device that
includes a device body having a first longitudinal axis, and an integral
heater-thermocouple having a second longitudinal axis that intersects the
first longitudinal axis to form an oblique angle. Id. at 17–18.
REJECTIONS
The Examiner maintains the following rejections in the Examiner’s
Answer entered May 10, 2024 (“Ans.”):

Application 16/929,475

3
I. claims 1, 2, 4–6, and 9–18 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as
unpatentable over Boham3 in view of Moloney4 and Batista;5 and
II. claims 19 and 20 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as unpatentable over
Boham in view of Moloney, Batista, and Fraser.6

FACTUAL FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS
After considering the evidence relied upon in this appeal and each of
the Appellant’s contentions, we reverse the Examiner’s rejections under
35 U.S.C. § 103 for reasons set forth in the Appeal Brief, the Reply Brief,
and below.
We need address independent claims 1 and 17 only, which recite a
non-nicotine cartridge for a non-nicotine e-vaping device that includes a
housing or device body having a first longitudinal axis, and an integral
heater-thermocouple having a second longitudinal axis that intersects the
first longitudinal axis to form an oblique angle.
The Examiner rejects claims 1 and 17 as obvious over Boham in view
of Moloney and Batista.
Boham discloses aerosol provision system 1, illustrated in Boham’s
Figure 1:

Figure 1 is a cross-sectional schematic representation of Boham’s aerosol
provision system. Boham 3:6–7.
As shown in Figure 1, aerosol provision system 1 includes reservoir
44 containing liquid aerosolisable material (e-liquid) within housing 42.
Boham 5:21–22. Reservoir 44 has an annular shape defined by housing 42
and an inner wall that defines air path 52. Id. at 5:23–24. Aerosol provision
system 1 further includes wick 63 and heater 65 formed of an electrically
resistive wire coiled around wick 63. Id. at 5:31–32, 6:7–8. Wick 63
extends transversely across air path 52 and its ends extend into openings in
the inner wall of reservoir 44. Id. at 5:33–34. In operation, electrical power
is supplied to heater 65, which vaporizes aerosolizable material (e-liquid)
drawn to the vicinity of heater 65 by wick 63. Id. at 6:10–12. Vaporised eliquid then becomes entrained in air drawn along air path 52 to form a

5
condensation aerosol that exits the system through mouthpiece outlet 50 for
user inhalation. Id. at 6:12–14.
The Examiner finds that Boham does not disclose first and second
vapor channels spaced apart by a reservoir, and the Examiner turns to
Moloney. Final Act. 3.
Moloney discloses a vapor provision system that includes housing 42
having interior wall 48 positioned within inner volume 100 so as to divide
inner volume 100 into three regions: inner reservoir 50 for storing
aerosolizable material, and two air flow passages 54 located on each side of
reservoir 50. Moloney ¶ 79, Fig. 4. Each air flow passage 54 has a lower air
inlet 52 to allow air carrying vapor to enter each flow passage 54, and upper
air outlet 56 to allow air carrying vapor to exit each flow passage 54 for
delivery of aerosol to a user via a mouthpiece. Id. ¶ 82, Fig. 4.
In view of these disclosures in Moloney, the Examiner concludes that
it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to modify
Boham’s device to include two vapor channels spaced apart by a reservoir as
taught in Moloney because “doing so would carry vapor to the exit for
delivery to a user.” Final Act. 3 (citing Moloney ¶ 82).
The Examiner finds that neither Boham nor Moloney discloses a
housing having a first longitudinal axis and an integral heater thermocouple
having a second longitudinal axis that intersects the first longitudinal axis to
form an oblique angle, and the Examiner turns to Batista. Final Act. 4.
Batista discloses an aerosol-generating device that includes electric
heaters extending across an annular airflow passage formed by first and
second hollow shaft portions. Batista ¶¶ 36, 50, Fig. 1. Paragraph 52 of
Batista states that “[w]here one or more of the electric heaters extend across

Appeal 2024-003328
Application 16/929,475

6
the airflow passage, the longitudinal axis of one or more of the electric
heaters may be perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the hollow shaft
portion.” The next sentence in paragraph 52 states that “[o]ne or more of the
electric heaters extending across the airflow passage may be arranged such
that its longitudinal axis is oblique to the longitudinal axis of the hollow
shaft portion.”
In the following paragraph (53), Batista describes, in general terms,
embodiments of its device in which electric heaters are disposed as
described in the first sentence of paragraph 52—their longitudinal axes are
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the airflow passage (hollow shaft
portion)—but the longitudinal axis of one or more of the heaters is rotated
within the airflow passage relative to that of the other heaters. Batista later
describes (and also illustrates) three embodiments of its aerosol-generating
device in which the longitudinal axes of the electric heaters are
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the airflow passage (hollow shaft
portion) and either parallel to each other or rotated relative to each other, as
described in paragraph 53. Batista ¶¶ 132, 154, 155, Figs. 1, 6A, 6B, 6C,
7A, 7B.
In the first embodiment, the longitudinal axes of electric heaters 400
are parallel and rotationally aligned within airflow passage 306. Id. ¶ 132,
Fig. 1. In the second embodiment (illustrated below in Figures 6A and 6B),
the longitudinal axis of central heater 403 is rotated by 90 degrees about the
longitudinal axis of the airflow passage (hollow shaft portions 604, 624)
relative to first 401 and second 405 heaters, such that the longitudinal axis of
heater 403 is perpendicular to that of heaters 401, 405. Id. ¶ 154, Figs. 6A,
6B, 6C. In the third embodiment (illustrated below in Figures 7A and 7B),

Appeal 2024-003328
Application 16/929,475

7
the longitudinal axes of electric heaters 401, 403, 405 are each rotated about
the longitudinal axis of the airflow passage (hollow shaft portions 702, 704)
relative to each other. Id. ¶ 155 (“[t]he longitudinal axis of each electric
heater 401, 403, 405 is rotated by a uniform amount of less than about 90
degrees from its adjacent electric heater or heaters”); see also id. Figs. 7A,
7B.


Figure 6A illustrates a longitudinal cross-section of a second embodiment of
Batista’s heater, Figure 6B illustrates a distal end view of the heater
assembly of FIG. 6A, Figure 7A illustrates a longitudinal cross-section of a
second embodiment of Batista’s heater, and Figure 7B illustrates a distal end
view of the heater assembly of FIG. 7A. Id. ¶¶ 16, 17, 19, 20.

The longitudinal axes of the electric heaters of all three of Batista’s
embodiments thus extend across the airflow passage transverse (or
perpendicular) to the airflow passage’s longitudinal axis, and in the second
and third embodiments, the longitudinal axes of one or two of the heaters is
rotated about the longitudinal axis of the airflow passage relative to that of
the other heaters.
Back to paragraph 53, Batista describes advantages of such rotated
configurations of the electric heaters (the arrangements of the second and
third embodiments) relative to an arrangement in which the longitudinal
axes of electric heaters are aligned within the airflow passage (hollow shaft
portions) (the first embodiment): (1) the heaters may more readily intercept
air flowing through the devices, (2) the devices may more uniformly
consume aerosol-forming substrate, reducing waste, and (3) leaked liquid
may more readily be intercepted and absorbed into an adjacent electric
heater, reducing liquid leakage. Id. ¶ 53.
In view of the disclosures in Batista’s paragraphs 52 and 53, the
Examiner determines that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
skill in the art to modify Boham’s device as modified by Moloney “to
provide wherein the housing has a first longitudinal axis, and integral heater
thermocouple has a second longitudinal axis that intersects the first
longitudinal axis to form an oblique angle,” as disclosed in Batista. Final
Act. 5 (citing Batista ¶¶ 52, 53). The Examiner reasons that “[a] person of
ordinary skill in the art would obviously place the heater at an oblique angle
to the housing because doing so would more readily intercept air flowing
[through the device] allowing for the device to more uniformly consume
aerosol-forming substrate thereby reducing waste.” Id. (citing Batista ¶ 53).

As the Appellant correctly points out (Appeal Br. 10–11), however,
and as discussed above, Batista discloses that these advantageous features
result from disposing the longitudinal axes of Batista’s electric heaters
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the airflow passage, but rotated
relative to each other. Batista ¶ 53. Contrary to the Examiner’s findings,
Batista does not disclose that these advantages stem from disposing the
longitudinal axes of one or more of Batista’s electric heaters at an oblique
angle relative to the longitudinal axis of Batista’s airflow passage.
The Examiner’s rationale for modifying the angle of the longitudinal
axis of Boham’s heater 65 relative to that of Boham’s housing 42, therefore,
lacks rational underpinning. Stated another way, the Examiner does not
provide sound technical reasoning supported by objective evidence
sufficient to persuasively explain why the relied-upon disclosures of Batista
would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the angle of the
longitudinal axis of Boham’s heater 65 as the Examiner proposes.
Furthermore, as discussed above, the Examiner initially proposes
modifying Boham’s system to include two vapor channels spaced apart by a
reservoir as Moloney discloses. The Examiner does not explain where
Boham’s heater would be disposed in this modified system. Nonetheless,
the Examiner proposes further modifying Boham’s device in view of Batista
to change the angle at which the longitudinal axis of Boham’s heater is
positioned relative to the longitudinal axis of Boham’s housing (as discussed
above). But because the Examiner does not explain in the first instance
where Boham’s heater would be located in Boham’s device as initially
modified in view of Moloney, the Examiner does not explain how Boham’s
device would be further modified—while preserving the device’s intended

Appeal 2024-003328
Application 16/929,475

10
functionality—to position the longitudinal axis of Boham’s heater at an
oblique angle relative to the housing’s longitudinal axis.
In particular, as the Appellant argues (Reply Br. 7–9), the Examiner’s
proposed modification of Boham’s device in view of Moloney would
apparently replace Boham’s inner air path 52 and outer reservoir 44 with an
inner reservoir and outer air path, resulting in Boham’s heater 65 no longer
extending across Boham’s inner air path 52. The Examiner does not explain
where Boham’s heater 65 would be positioned after this modification.
Batista’s electric heaters, like Boham’s heater, function by extending across
an airflow passage (as discussed above). The Examiner does not explain
how the intended function of Boham’s heater 65, and Boham’s device as a
whole, would be preserved if heater 65 no longer extended across an inner
air path.
The Examiner, therefore, does not provide a sufficient factual basis to
establish that the relied-upon disclosures of Boham, Moloney, and Batista
would have suggested a non-nicotine cartridge having an integral heaterthermocouple positioned as recited in claims 1 and 17.
We, accordingly, do not sustain the Examiner’s obviousness rejection
of claims 1, 2, 4–6, and 9–18 (Rejection I). We also do not sustain the
Examiner’s obviousness rejection of claims 19 and 20 (Rejection II) because
the Examiner does not rely on any disclosure in Fraser that remedies the
deficiencies of the Examiner’s reliance on Boham, Moloney, and Batista.
