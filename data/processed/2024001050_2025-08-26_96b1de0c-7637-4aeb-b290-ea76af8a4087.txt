CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claims are directed to a “[m]ethod for achieving goals through
emphasis on persistence.” Title. Claim 1, reproduced below, is illustrative of
the claimed subject matter:
1. A method for enhancing a student’s likelihood of
achieving success, said method comprising the steps of:
a) encouraging the student to set a goal;
b) encouraging the student to formulate milestones
toward achieving the goal;
c) encouraging the student to attempt to progress through
the milestones;
d) encouraging the student to record her progress through
the milestones;
e) monitoring the student’s progress through the
milestones;
f) determining whether the student is using maximal
effort to proceed through the milestones;
g) providing positive feedback to the student upon her
success in proceeding through one or more milestones while
using maximal effort;
h) providing positive feedback to the student upon her
failure to proceed through one or more milestones while using
maximal effort;
i) emphasizing that struggle and failure are expected and
necessary aspects of achieving the goal and that effort and
persistence are the most important factors in achieving the goal;
and
l) training a teacher to perform said steps a) through i) by
providing the teacher with access to an online portal that

REJECTIONS
Claims 1–12, 14–17, 19, 20, 22, and 23 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.
§ 101 as directed to patent-ineligible subject matter. Final Act. 15–20.
Claims 1–12, 14–17, 19, 20, 22, and 23 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103 as obvious over Brock. Final Act. 50–53.
OPINION
The Eligibility Rejection of Claims 1–12, 14–17, 19, 20, 22, and 23
The Examiner determines independent claim 1 is directed to a judicial
exception without significantly more. Final Act. 15–20. The Examiner
determines certain claim limitations fall within certain methods of
organizing human activity and/or mental processes groupings of abstract
ideas. See Final Act. 18 (“Thus, the limitations identified above recite an
abstract idea since the limitations correspond to certain methods of
organizing human activity, and/or mental processes, which are part of the
enumerated groupings of abstract ideas identified according to the current
eligibility standard (see MPEP 2106.04(a) [(9th ed. rev. 07.2022 Feb.
2023)]). For instance, the current claims correspond to managing personal
behavior or evaluation, wherein a student is presented with one or more
advices in order to increase the student’s chance to succeed in achieving a

Appeal 2024-001050
Application 16/428,977
4
goal, etc.”). The Examiner further determines the judicial exception is not
integrated into a practical application. Final Act. 18–19. The Examiner
further determines the claims do not include additional elements that are
sufficient to amount to significantly more than the judicial exception. Final
Act. 19–20.
Appellant presents the following principal arguments:
Step 2A, Prong 2
Regarding claim 1, “the combination of at least steps h), i), and l)
implements the abstract idea with a particular machine or manufacture,
namely the online portal, that is integral to the claim.” Appeal Br. 16.
Although an online portal may be a conventional
element, it is the appropriate element to solve for the particular
problem of providing the information to many different types of
people in many different types of settings. Access by anyone,
anywhere is integral to the claim and the online portal
addresses this requirement.

Appeal Br. 17. “That being provided with this information and resources is
integral to enabling steps h) and i) is supported by ¶ 8 of the declarations of
Ms. Bruce, Mr. Alfonso, and Ms. Johnson.” Appeal Br. 18.
Step 2B
“[T]he additional element of the online portal, in combination with
novel, nonobvious steps h) and i) and the remainder of step l), amounts to
significantly more than an abstract idea.” Appeal Br. 18. “The additional
element of the online portal in step 1) is not a well-understood, routine, or
conventional activity because the content it is providing is novel.” Appeal
Br. 19. “[T]he Examiner has not established that the online portal is wellunderstood, routine, or conventional when considered in combination with
the steps of the present invention.” Appeal Br. 21.

We review the appealed rejections for error based upon the issues
identified by Appellant, and in light of the arguments and evidence produced
thereon. Ex parte Frye, 94 USPQ2d 1072, 1075 (BPAI 2010) (precedential).
We select claim 1 as representative.
Are the claims patent-eligible?
Step 1
Claim 1 is the sole independent claim. Claim 1 recites a method,
which falls within the “process” category of 35 U.S.C. § 101.
Thus, we must determine whether the claim recites a judicial
exception, and fails to integrate the exception into a practical application. If
both elements are satisfied, the claim is directed to a judicial exception under
the first step of the Alice/Mayo test. Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 573 U.S.
208 (2014); Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S.
66 (2012).
Step 2A, Prong 1
Claim 1 recites the following steps:
a) encouraging the student to set a goal;
b) encouraging the student to formulate milestones
toward achieving the goal;
c) encouraging the student to attempt to progress through
the milestones;
d) encouraging the student to record her progress through
the milestones;
e) monitoring the student’s progress through the
milestones;
f) determining whether the student is using maximal
effort to proceed through the milestones;

Appeal 2024-001050
Application 16/428,977
6
g) providing positive feedback to the student upon her
success in proceeding through one or more milestones while
using maximal effort;
h) providing positive feedback to the student upon her
failure to proceed through one or more milestones while using
maximal effort;
i) emphasizing that struggle and failure are expected and
necessary aspects of achieving the goal and that effort and
persistence are the most important factors in achieving the goal;
and
l) training a teacher to perform said steps a) through i) by
providing the teacher with access to an online portal that
provides at least information regarding said steps a) through i)
and resources pertaining to steps a) through i).
We determine steps a)–i) describe “managing personal behavior or
relationships or interactions between people, (including social activities,
teaching, and following rules or instructions).” MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)(II). In
short, the various steps a)–i) describe teaching—a fundamental activity that
has been long been performed by humans—which falls within the “[c]ertain
methods of organizing human activity” grouping of abstract ideas. MPEP
§ 2106.04(a)(2)(II); see also Final Act 18.
Step 2A, Prong 1 determines whether the claims recite a judicial
exception, while Step 2A, Prong 2 determines whether the claims are
directed to the judicial exception. Appellant’s arguments do not squarely
focus on the Step 2A, Prong 1 inquiry.
Thus, we determine claim 1 recites a judicial exception under Step
2A, Prong 1.

Appeal 2024-001050
Application 16/428,977

Step 2A, Prong 2
Because claim 1 recites a judicial exception, we next determine if the
claim recites additional elements that integrate the judicial exception into a
practical application.
In addition to the limitations of claim 1 discussed above that recite
abstract concepts, claim 1 further recites the step “l) training a teacher to
perform said steps a) through i) by providing the teacher with access to an
online portal that provides at least information regarding said steps a)
through i) and resources pertaining to steps a) through i).”
We determine step “l) training a teacher to perform said steps a)
through i) by providing the teacher with access to an online portal that
provides at least information regarding said steps a) through i) and resources
pertaining to steps a) through i)” does not add meaningful limitations to the
judicial exception because it is merely directed to the insignificant postsolution activity of data outputting. See MPEP § 2106.05(g); see also Final
Act. 19 (“[T]he above additional element is utilized merely to facilitate the
abstract idea (e.g. providing access to information or resources via an
online portal). The above demonstrates that the claimed additional element
is utilized merely as a tool to implement the abstract idea.”); Ans. 31–36.
Contrary to Appellant’s arguments, we do not agree that the abstract
idea is implemented with a particular machine. Although Appellant argues
that the online portal solves a particular problem, we determine the online
portal is insignificant post-solution activity. In short, providing an online
portal, with nothing more, is no more than extra-solution, conventional data
outputting.
Further, Appellant’s argument “[t]hat being provided with this
information and resources is integral to enabling steps h) and i) is supported

Appeal 2024-001050
Application 16/428,977
8
by ¶ 8 of the declarations of Ms. Bruce, Mr. Alfonso, and Ms. Johnson”
(Appeal Br. 19) also does not show reversible error. Steps h) and i) are part
of the abstract idea, and thus, do not integrate the abstract idea into a
practical application. Step l) recites providing information; however,
providing information as recited provides no more than extra-solution,
conventional data outputting.
Thus, we determine claim 1 is directed to a judicial exception under
Step 2A, Prong 2.

Is there something else in the claims that ensures that they are
directed to significantly more than a patent ineligible concept?
Step 2B
Because claim 1 is directed to a judicial exception, we must
determine, according to Alice, whether the claim recites an element or
combination of elements that is enough to ensure that the claim is directed to
significantly more than a judicial exception.
In addition to the limitations of claim 1 discussed above that recite
abstract concepts, claim 1 further recites the step “l) training a teacher to
perform said steps a) through i) by providing the teacher with access to an
online portal that provides at least information regarding said steps a)
through i) and resources pertaining to steps a) through i).”
Regarding step “l) training a teacher to perform said steps a) through
i) by providing the teacher with access to an online portal that provides at
least information regarding said steps a) through i) and resources pertaining
to steps a) through i),” our reviewing court has recognized that sending and
receiving data are well-understood, routine, and conventional activities. See
buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc., 765 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“That

Appeal 2024-001050
Application 16/428,977
9
a computer receives and sends the information over a network—with no
further specification—is not even arguably inventive.”); see also MPEP
2106.05(d), Final Act. 19 (“[T]he claimed additional element is directed to
conventional computer element, which is serving merely to perform
conventional computer functions. Accordingly, none of the current claims
recites an element—or a combination of elements—directed to an ‘inventive
concept’.”), Ans. 36–43.
Contrary to Appellant’s arguments, we do not agree that the additional
element of the online portal amounts to significantly more than the abstract
idea. Further, although Appellant argues that the content provided is novel,
the content from the previous steps in claim 1 is part of the abstract idea and
does not provide significantly more than a patent ineligible concept. In short,
step l) recites providing information; however, providing information as
recited provides no more than extra-solution, conventional data outputting.
Thus, we determine claim 1 is not directed to significantly more than
a patent ineligible concept.
We, therefore, sustain the rejection of claim 1.
We also sustain the rejection of claims 2–12, 14–17, 19, 20, 22, and
23, which are not separately argued with particularity. See Appeal Br. 16–
21.

The Obviousness Rejection of Claims 1–12, 14–17, 19, 20, 22, and 23
The Examiner finds Brock teaches all limitations of claim 1. Final
Act. 50–51. In particular, the Examiner finds,
Although Brock does not explicitly describe, “g)
providing positive feedback to the student upon her success in
proceeding through one or more milestones while using maximal

Appeal 2024-001050
Application 16/428,977
10
effort; h) providing positive feedback to the student upon her
failure to proceed through one or more milestones while using
maximal effort; i) emphasizing that struggle and failure are
expected and necessary aspects of achieving the goal and that
effort and persistence are the most important factors in achieving
the goal ”, the above limitations are directed to interactions or
conversations that a user —such as an educator —makes with a
student.
In this regard, Brock already describes that the educator
interacts with the student; for example, by asking t he student
various questions regarding the student’s goals, etc. ([0035]).
Accordingly, it would have been obvious to one of
ordinary skill in the art, before the effective filing date of the
claimed invention, to modify Brock’s implementation; for
example, by making an arrangement that allows the educator to
provide advice and/or some recommendations to the student,
etc., so that the student would not face significant burden to
achieve his/her goals.
Final Act. 51.
Appellant presents the following principal arguments:
“[T]he content of the messages provided in steps h) and i) must be
given patentable weight.” Appeal Br. 7; see also Appeal Br. 12–16 (arguing
that steps h), i), and l) include printed matter that should be given patentable
weight).
While [Brock’s outcomes are] laudable, these outcomes
accurately represent the entirety of Brock in that they do not
touch on the importance of the student using maximal effort to
achieve her goals and do not touch on the paramount messages
of steps h) and i) of the present invention —that failure while
using maximal effort is to be praised; that struggle and failure are
expected and necessary aspects of goal achievement; and that
effort and persistence are the most important factors in goal
achievement.
Appeal Br. 8.

Appeal 2024-001050
Application 16/428,977
11
“Contrary to the Examiner’s statement, it would not have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, before the effective filing date of
the claimed invention, to modify Brock’s implementation. This is because
steps h) and i) were not known prior to the present invention.” Appeal Br. 9
(citing Declarations of Christi Leigh, Melissa Bruce, Erick Alfonso,
Christine Johnson).
In response, the Examiner explains “the content/topic of the feedback
(verbal remark) does not have a patentable weight since it is directed to
nonfunctional descriptive matter.” Ans. 4.
We review the appealed rejections for error based upon the issues
identified by Appellant, and in light of the arguments and evidence produced
thereon. Frye, 94 USPQ2d at 1075.
We select claim 1 as representative.
“Claim limitations directed to printed matter are not entitled to
patentable weight unless the printed matter is functionally related to the
substrate on which the printed matter is applied.” Praxair Distribution, Inc.
v. Mallinckrodt Hosp. Prods. IP Ltd., 890 F.3d 1024, 1031 (Fed. Cir. 2018)
(emphasis added). Our reviewing court has also explained that this printed
matter doctrine is not strictly limited to “printed” materials. Praxair, 890
F.3d at 1032. More specifically, “a claim limitation is directed to printed
matter ‘if it claims the content of information.’” Praxair, 890 F.3d at 1032
(quoting In re Distefano, 808 F.3d 845, 848 (Fed. Cir. 2015)).
“Where the printed matter is not functionally related to the substrate,
the printed matter will not distinguish the invention from the prior art in
terms of patentability.” In re Gulack, 703 F.2d 1381, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 1983)
(footnote omitted). As a general proposition, we need not give patentable
weight to non-functional descriptive material absent a new and nonobvious

Appeal 2024-001050
Application 16/428,977
12
structural or functional relationship between the descriptive material and the
substrate. See In re Ngai, 367 F.3d 1336, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also
King Pharm., Inc. v. Eon Labs, Inc., 616 F.3d 1267, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2010);
MPEP § 2111.05.
In Ex parte Nehls, 88 USPQ2d 1883, 1888 (BPAI 2008)
(precedential), the Board held that the nature of the information being
manipulated by the computer should not be given patentable weight absent
evidence that the information is functionally related to the process “by
changing the efficiency or accuracy or any other characteristic” of the steps.
See also Ex parte Curry, 84 USPQ2d 1272, 1274 (BPAI 2005) (nonprecedential) (holding “wellness-related” data stored in a database and
communicated over a network was non-functional descriptive material as
claimed because the data “does not functionally change” the system).
“Today, printed matter encompasses any information claimed for its
communicative content, and the doctrine prohibits patenting such printed
matter unless it is ‘functionally related’ to its ‘substrate,’ which encompasses
the structural elements of the claimed invention.” C R Bard Inc. v.
AngioDynamics, Inc., 979 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (citing Praxair,
890 F.3d at 1032; Distefano, 808 F.3d at 848–49). To determine whether a
functional relationship exists, Bard instructs us to consider “whether the
printed matter merely informs people of the claimed information, or whether
it instead interacts with the other elements of the claim to create a new
functionality in a claimed device or to cause a specific action in a claimed
process.” Bard, 979 F.3d at 1381.
Regarding the step “h) providing positive feedback to the student upon
her failure to proceed through one or more milestones while using maximal
effort” (claim 1 (emphasis added)), this subject matter recites information—

Appeal 2024-001050
Application 16/428,977
13
positive feedback—claimed for its communicative content, and thus, recites
printed matter. Further, this printed matter merely informs the student of the
claimed information and the claim does not recite using or otherwise
interacting with the content; therefore, the content is non-functional
descriptive material that does not patentably distinguish over Brock.
Similarly, the step “i) emphasizing that struggle and failure are
expected and necessary aspects of achieving the goal and that effort and
persistence are the most important factors in achieving the goal” (claim 1
(emphasis added)) recites information claimed for its communicative
content, and thus, recites printed matter. Further, this printed matter also
merely informs the student of the claimed information and the claim does
not recite using or otherwise interacting with the content; therefore, the
content is non-functional descriptive material that does not patentably
distinguish over Brock.
Finally, the step “l) training a teacher to perform said steps a) through
i) by providing the teacher with access to an online portal that provides at
least information regarding said steps a) through i) and resources
pertaining to steps a) through i)” recites information claimed for its
communicative content, and thus, recites printed matter. Further, this printed
matter merely informs the teacher of the claimed information and the claim
does not recite using or otherwise interacting with the content; therefore, the
content is non-functional descriptive material that does not patentably
distinguish over Brock.
Appellant’s arguments do not show reversible error for the reasons
discussed above. In short, we do not give patentable weight to the
information claimed for its communicative content.
We, therefore, sustain the rejection of claim 1.

Appeal 2024-001050

We also sustain the rejection of claims 2–12, 14–17, 19, 20, 22, and
23, which are not separately argued with particularity. See Appeal Br. 6–16.
CONCLUSION
The Examiner’s decision to reject claims 1–12, 14–17, 19, 20, 22, and
