OPINION
Anticipation by Bastian
Independent claim 5 and dependent claims 6, 7, 10, and 13
Independent claim 5 requires, inter alia, “a robotic drive unit
configured to traverse the plurality of storage grid locations via respective

surfaces of the plurality of highway grids, the at least one elevator, and the
plurality of storage grid locations, the robotic drive unit configured to move
a respective tote.” Appeal Br. 11.
In contesting the rejection of claim 5 as being anticipated by Bastian,
Appellant argues that
the cited sections of Bastian do not disclose a robotic drive unit
that is configured to traverse “via respective surfaces of the
plurality of highway grids, the at least one elevator, and the
plurality of storage grid locations. ” Appellant respectfully
submits that the shuttle of Bastian does not traverse at least via
surfaces of the plurality of storage grid locations because the
shuttle travels along rails of the shuttle frame “and on a surface
outside of the rack system,” in which the “rack has storage
locations for containers. ” As a result, the Abstract of Bastian
makes clear that its shuttle at least does not traverse via surfaces
of the storage locations of its rack because the shuttle remains
“outside of the rack system.”

Appeal Br. 6.
In particular, Appellant argues that “the cited sections related to the
container transfer mechanism of Bastian are inapplicable to the aboverecited features of claim 5” because “nowhere do the cited sections of
Bastian describe or suggest that the shuttle itself traverses via respective
surfaces of the plurality of storage grid locations.” Id. at 7 (citing Final
Act. 3; Adv. Act. 2). Appellant states that “the plain meaning of the term
‘via’ is defined as ‘by way of’ or ‘by means of,’ such that the robotic drive
unit traverses, travels on, or moves to storage grid locations by way of, or by
means of, respective surfaces of . . . the plurality of storage grid locations”
(Reply Br. 7). According to Appellant, “[a]lthough the container transfer
mechanism of Bastian may extend from the shuttle toward storage locations
of the rack, there is absolutely no discussion of the shuttle of Bastian

traversing along any surfaces of the plurality of storage grid locations” and
“one of ordinary skill in the art would not consider extension of the
container transfer mechanism of Bastian from the shuttle toward storage
locations to somehow constitute disclosure of the shuttle of Bastian
traversing via respective surfaces of the plurality of storage grid locations.”
Id. at 5. We are persuaded by Appellant’s argument.
Bastian does not anticipate claim 5 because “rejections under 35
U.S.C. § 102 are proper only when the claimed subject matter is identically
disclosed or described in the prior art.” In re Arkley, 455 F.2d 586, 587
(CCPA 1972) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, in
response to Appellant’s argument, the Examiner maintains that Bastian’s
container transfer mechanism including “extendable conveyors (740)
configured to extend laterally from the shuttle to a position underneath a
target container inside a storage rack location” anticipates the limitation “a
robotic drive unit configured to traverse the plurality of storage grid
locations via respective surfaces of . . . the plurality of storage grid
locations” as required by claim 5. Ans. 5. We agree with Appellant “that the
shuttle of Bastian does not traverse at least via surfaces of the plurality of
storage grid locations because the shuttle travels along rails of the shuttle
frame ‘and on a surface outside of the rack system,’ in which the ‘rack has
storage locations for containers.’” Reply Br. 3–4. In other words, even
though Bastian’s “extendable conveyors or other container transfer
mechanisms can store and retrieve containers from storage locations, the
shuttles of Bastian clearly do not traverse via respective surfaces of the
storage locations of the rack system.” Id. at 6.

The Examiner admits that Bastian’s “rack system includes a plurality
of racks (205) with storage locations in which items are stored, and a shuttle
frame (210) on which the shuttles are able to travel alongside the racks
when storing and retrieving containers from storage locations” and that the
shuttles “access various storage locations along the racks at different storage
rack levels.” Ans. 4. Yet, the Examiner states, without any supporting
citations or evidence, that “Bastian expressly teaches an autonomous mobile
robot configured to travel vertically and horizontally across storage grid
locations via travel lanes and elevator sections of the shuttle frame within
the rack system” (id. at 6).
We have reviewed the citations to Bastian and we agree with
Appellant that “[n]one of the cited sections of Bastian describes that its
shuttles ‘travel vertically and horizontally across storage grid locations . . .
within the rack system.’” Reply Br. 6. Rather, Bastian expressly discloses
that “[t]he shuttle frame 3615 allows the shuttles 3605 to travel along the
racks 3610 and service the various storage rows 215, rack columns 220, and
rack levels 225” (Bastian 19:63–65), “the travel lanes 310 of the shuttle
frame 3615 includes one or more rack rails 320 along which the shuttles
3605 travel between the racks 3610” and “[t]he shuttles 3605 are able to
independently move along the floor outside of the storage rack system 3600
so as to transfer items between various external service locations and the
storage rack system 3600.” Bastian 20:6–12 (emphasis added). As such, the
cited sections of Bastian do not anticipate the disputed limitation of claim 5.
Accordingly, we do not sustain the rejection of claim 5 as being
anticipated by Bastian and claims 6, 7, 10 and 13, which depend from
claim 5.

Obviousness over Bastian
Dependent claims 11 and 12
We do not sustain the rejection of claims 11 and 12, which depend
from claim 5, for the reasons discussed above.
Obviousness over Bastian & DeWitt
Independent claim 1 and dependent claims 2–4, 8, 9, 14, and 15
Independent claim 1 recites “a plurality of robotic drive units
configured to traverse the plurality of floors and the plurality of storage grid
locations by traveling on respective surfaces of … the plurality of storage
grid locations” which is similarly rejected as claim 5 under Bastian. See
Final Act. 7. For the same reasons discussed above, we do not sustain the
rejection of claim 1 and dependent claims 2–4.
We do not sustain the rejection of claims 8, 9, 14, and 15, which
depend from claim 5, for the same reasons. Additionally, we note that the
Examiner does not rely on DeWitt to remedy the deficiency discussed
above.
Independent claim 16 and dependent claims 17–20
Independent claim 16 recites:
A method, comprising:
determining, by a controller, a respective floor of a
plurality of floors associated with a respective tote, the plurality
of floors being connected by at least one elevator;
determining, by the controller, a respective storage grid
location of a plurality of storage grid locations on the respective
floor associated with the respective tote; and
instructing, by the controller, a robotic drive unit to move
to the respective tote at the respective floor and the respective
storage grid location via respective surfaces of at least a portion
of a plurality of highway grids, the at least one elevator, and the
plurality of storage grid locations.

In contesting the rejection of claim 16 as unpatentable over Bastian
and DeWitt, Appellant only argues that instructing step of claim 16. See
Appeal Br. 5. Appellant’s arguments however are directed to Bastian
because Appellant asserts: “Claims 1 and 16 include features similar to those
discussed above with respect to claim 5. Further, DeWitt is not asserted to
cure the deficiencies noted above with respect to Bastian.” Appeal Br. 18;
Reply Br. 8.
In rejecting claim 16 as unpatentable over Bastian and DeWitt, the
Examiner however relies on Dewitt not Bastian to reject the disputed
instructing step. See Final Act. 11–14. As such, Appellant’s arguments do
not apprise us of error in the Examiner’s finding as to DeWitt. Thus, we
sustain the rejection of claims 16 and dependent claims 17–20, which are not
argued.
CONCLUSION
The rejection of claims 5–7, 10, and 13 as anticipated by Bastian is
REVERSED.
The rejection of claims 1–4, 8, 9, 14, and 15 as unpatentable over
Bastian and DeWitt is REVERSED.
The rejection of claims 16–20 as unpatentable over Bastian and
DeWitt is AFFIRMED.
The rejection 11 and 12 as unpatentable over Bastian is REVERSED.
