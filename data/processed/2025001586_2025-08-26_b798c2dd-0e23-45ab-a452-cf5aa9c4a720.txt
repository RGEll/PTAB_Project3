We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We REVERSE.


1 “Appellant” refers to “applicant” as defined in 37 C.F.R. § 1.42. Appellant
identifies the real party in interest as “SPECIALTY OPERATIONS

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Appellant’s disclosure “relates to cosmetic compositions exhibiting
both conditioning and cleansing properties for the simultaneous care and
washing of keratinous materials” (Karagianni3 ¶ 3). Appellant’s claim 1, the
only independent claim on this record, is reproduced below:
1. A cosmetic cleansing composition comprising at least:
a) one or more vegetable oil(s), in an amount of at least 0.3
pbw relative to the total weight of the composition,
b) from about 2 pbw to about 40 pbw, relative to the total
weight of the composition, of a surfactant system
comprising at least one sultaine surfactant and at least one
taurate surfactant, and
c) at least 0.1 pbw, relative to the total weight of the
composition, of a non-ionic solubilizer which is a mono- or
poly- alkyl or alkenyl ester of an alkoxylated fatty acid,
with said fatty acid being a saturated or unsaturated
hydroxylated C8-C22 fatty acid.
(Appeal Br. 33 (emphasis added).)
The following grounds of rejection are before us for review:
I. Claims 1–7, 9–13, 15–19, and 21–25 stand rejected under 35
U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over Bendejacq.4
II. Claim 26 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being
unpatentable over the combination of Bendejacq and Hough.5

ISSUE
Does the preponderance of evidence on this record support a
conclusion of obviousness?
ANALYSIS
Appellant’s claim 1, the only independent claim on this record, is
reproduced above. As emphasized above, the cosmetic cleansing
composition of Appellant’s claim 1 comprises, inter alia, a non-ionic
solubilizer. For the following reasons, we find that Examiner failed to
establish, by a preponderance of evidence, that Bendejacq alone or in
combination with Hough supports a conclusion of obviousness.
I
The rejection over Bendejacq:
Bendejacq discloses: “[A]queous compositions that are suitable as
shampoos,” wherein “[t]he composition comprises an oil and provides an
interesting hair treatment, especially an interesting hair treatment targeting
damaged hair” (Bendejacq ¶ 1). In particular, Bendejacq discloses a
composition comprising:
a) a structured surfactant system comprising:
non cationic surfactant(s), and
a cationic co-surfactant
b) an oil, being
b1) a silicone oil, or
b2) an oil of mineral origin, and
c) optionally a cationic or ampholytic polymer.
(Bendejacq ¶¶ 7–11.) Bendejacq discloses that its “composition might
comprise some further ingredients,” that “can impart some further specific
properties to the composition,” wherein “one skilled in the art knows such
ingredients and/or properties that can be associated to these and/or

4
appropriate amounts (Bendejacq ¶ 170). “In one embodiment . . .
[Bendejacq discloses that its] composition comprises a rheology modifier,”
which “are known by the one skilled in the art,” and “can be used to adjust
the viscosity and/or the stability of the composition” (Bendejacq ¶ 171).
Bendejacq exemplifies a multitude, i.e. nearly four columns worth, of
different rheology modifiers, that can be of natural or synthetic origin (see
e.g., Bendejacq ¶¶ 173–174).
Among Bendejacq’s extensive listing of rheology modifiers,
Examiner selects PEG-18 Castor Oil Dioleate (see Ans.6 4 (citing Bendejacq
¶ 174)). Although Bendejacq identifies PEG-18 Castor Oil Dioleate as a
rheology modifier, Examiner characterizes this compound as a non-ionic
solubilizer and more specifically a non-ionic solubilizer that would have
been useful to formulate Appellant’s claimed invention (see id.).
Examiner does not identify, and we do not find, a disclosure of a solubilizer
of any type in Bendejacq (see generally Appeal Br. 21). Examiner,
however, directs attention to Appellant’s Specification, wherein Appellant
disclosed PEG-18 Castor Oil Dioleate, “an oleic acid diester of ethoxylated
castor oil,” “as a suitable solubilizer of the invention . . . that maintains the
transparency of the composition” (Ans. 10–11 (citing Karagianni ¶¶ 92, 94–
96); see also id. at 16 (citing Karagianni ¶¶ 92, 94–96) (Examiner finds that
Appellant discloses that “PEG-18 Castor Oil Dioleate, which maintains
transparency of the instant composition . . . is the same compound as that of
Bendejacq, and has the same properties.”)).
Examiner did not establish an evidentiary basis on this record to
support a finding that rheology modifiers in general in Bendejacq’s

Appeal 2025-001586
Application 16/091,212
5
extensive listing would exhibit the properties of a non-ionic solublizer,
which is the component required by Appellant’s claimed invention, or would
maintain the transparency of that composition when used. Examiner also
failed to establish an evidentiary basis to support a finding that those of
ordinary skill in this art would have recognized PEG-18 Castor Oil Dioleate
as a suitable solubilizer for use in a cleansing composition such that it would
maintain the transparency of Appellant’s composition (Ans. 10–11 (relying
on Appellant’s Specification for a disclosure that PEG-18 Castor Oil
Dioleate can be used to maintain the transparency of a composition within
the scope of Appellant’s claimed invention.)).
“[R]ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere
conclusory statements; instead, there must be some articulated reasoning
with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of
obviousness.” In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Further,
“[t]he mere fact that the prior art may be modified in the manner suggested
by the Examiner does not make the modification obvious unless the prior art
suggested the desirability of the modification.” In re Fritch, 972 F.2d 1260,
1266 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (citing In re Gordon, 733 F.2d 900, 902 (Fed. Cir.
1984)). “It is impermissible to use the claimed invention as an instruction
manual or ‘template’ to piece together the teachings of the prior art so that
the claimed invention is rendered obvious.” Fritch, 972 F.2d at 1266 (citing
In re Gorman, 933 F.2d 982, 987 (Fed. Cir. 1991)).
In sum, we find Examiner findings, rationale, and conclusion on this
record to be (i) the epitome of impermissible hindsight bias; (ii) conclusory;
and (iii) unsupported by the evidence of record.
II

Appeal 2025-001586
Application 16/091,212
6
The rejection over the combination of Bendejacq and Hough:
Examiner failed to establish an evidentiary basis on this record to
support a conclusion that Hough makes up for the deficiencies in Bendejacq
discussed in § I above. Therefore, this rejection fails for the same reasons
discussed above.
CONCLUSION
The preponderance of evidence on this record fails to support a
conclusion of obviousness.
Rejection I: The rejection of claims 1–7, 9–13, 15–19, and 21–25
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over Bendejacq is reversed.
Rejection II: The rejection of claim 26 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as
being unpatentable over the combination of Bendejacq and Hough is
reversed.
