CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
Claims 1, 10, and 16 are independent claims. Claim 1 is reproduced
below.
1. A method of implementing a building-related service in a
building automation management system (BAMS) comprising a
plurality of building automation systems (BASs), the method
comprising:
receiving a request to create a building -related service
involving dynamic coordination between at least two BASs, the
at least two BASs configured to control different functions from
one another for a building, the request including a workflow
comprising a set of actions and configurations specified by a user
that define the building-related service;
generating, from the workflow, system description data;
instantiating, from the system description data, a blueprint
for the building -related service, the blueprint defining data
exchanges with the at least two BASs, information about target
hosts, and any dependencies to be resolved;
parsing the blueprint to resolve any dependencies;
building a deployment plan that includes a sequence of
steps and configurations for implementing the building -related
service; and
executing the deployment plan to implement the buildingrelated service;
wherein the building-related service is a software program
that interacts with one or more building sub -systems associated
with a building, and wherein the user is provided with an option
to save the building-related service for subsequent reuse to create
another building-related service.

OPINION
Independent Claims 1, 10, and 16
Appellant argues claims 1, 10, and 16 together, focusing on the
subject matter recited in claim 1, which is similarly recited in claims 10 and
16. See Appeal Br. 9–16.
Claim 1 recites a “workflow comprising a set of actions and
configurations specified by a user that define the building-related service.”
Appeal Br. 21 (Claims App.). Appellant argues “the process used by the
workflow engine to carry out the command in Park cannot be specified by a
user, as the Office contends via Jacobson,” and that the “combination would
entirely defeat the purpose of Park.” Appeal Br. 11.
The Examiner explains that Jacobson teaches allowing a user to
preprogram setting presets, schemes, building rules, and a schedule of
events, which could be used by Park’s rules and policies. Final Act. 13–14;

2 US 2012/0011126 A1, published Jan. 12, 2012.

Ans. 11. Appellant’s conclusory assertion that the process used by Park’s
workflow engine cannot be specified by a user is unpersuasive of Examiner
error. See Appeal Br. 11. Appellant’s challenges to Park alone further fails
to sufficiently show error in the Examiner’s obviousness rejection, which is
based on the combined teachings of Park and Jacobson. See Appeal Br. 11;
In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 426 (CCPA 1981).
In Reply, Appellant argues that the claimed “workflow” refers to a
“sequence of actions and configurations” and that Jacobson’s scheduling
system does not link the scheduling of electronic devices into a sequence
that defines a particular building-related service. Reply Br. 7–8.
Appellant’s argument that Jacobson does not teach the claimed “workflow”
is untimely and deemed waived. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.41(b)(2); In re Hyatt,
211 F.3d 1367, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (noting that an argument not first
raised in the brief to the Board is waived on appeal). Even considering
Appellant’s untimely argument, we find it unpersuasive of error.
Appellant’s construction of “workflow” to require a “sequence of actions
and configurations” is unsupported by the claim language, which merely
recites “a workflow comprising a set of actions and configurations.”
Compare Reply Br. 8 (emphasis added), with Appeal Br. 21 (Claims App.)
(emphasis added).
Claim 1 further recites “receiving a request to create a building-related
service involving dynamic coordination between at least two BASs, the at
least two BASs configured to control different functions from one another
for a building.” Appeal Br. 21 (Claims App.). Appellant argues Park
teaches controlling “two BASs that control the same function for a building,
namely, two HVAC subsystems.” Appeal Br. 12.

Appeal 2025-000477
Application 17/519,342

The Examiner explains that Park teaches many types of BAS systems,
including HVAC systems, lighting systems, and access control systems.
Final Act. 7–10; Ans. 13–16. The Examiner further identifies an example in
Park of coordinating the building HVAC system with its access control
system. Final Act. 9–10 (citing Park ¶ 52); Ans. 14–16 (citing Park ¶ 52).
In particular, Park discloses a natural language query stating the following:
“Receive priority notifications about temperature increases outside comfort
levels in the executive offices area while any of the executives are there.”
Park ¶ 52. Park discloses that “such a query may be resolved by accessing
two subsystems (e.g., an HVAC system and an access control system).”
Park ¶ 52.
Appellant’s arguments do not sufficiently address Park’s coordination
between an HVAC system as one BAS and a building’s access control
system as a second BAS. Appeal Br. 12; see also Park ¶ 56 (“Referring now
to FIG. 6E, a process 650 for implementing a cross-subsystem command is
shown . . . .”).
In Reply, Appellant asserts that Park “simply correlates the data” but
does not “coordinate operation of the HVAC system with operation of the
access control system.” Reply Br. 9. Appellant’s argument that Park does
not teach the claimed “dynamic coordination” is untimely and deemed
waived. See 37 C.F.R. § 41.41(b)(2); In re Hyatt, 211 F.3d at 1373.
Appellant’s conclusory assertion is also unpersuasive of error because it
merely asserts that the cited passages of Park do not teach or suggest the
“dynamic coordination” limitation without sufficient explanation. Reply
Br. 9; see 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(1)(iv); In re Lovin, 652 F.3d 1349, 1357
(Fed. Cir. 2011). Appellant does not sufficiently explain why Park’s

Appeal 2025-000477
Application 17/519,342
6
teaching of accessing two subsystems, correlating their data, and taking an
action is different from the claimed “dynamic coordination.” Reply Br. 9.
Claim 1 additionally recites “generating, from the workflow, system
description data.” Appeal Br. 21 (Claims App). The Examiner finds Park’s
“looking up of appropriate rules and polices for a specific subsystem”
teaches generating the claimed system description data. Final Act. 10 (citing
Park ¶ 56, Fig. 6E); Ans. 18. Appellant asserts that the steps of looking up
and finding a process as taught by Park do not teach generating data that
describes a system. Appeal Br. 13.
The Examiner explains that Park looks up “appropriate rules and
policies for a specific subsystem.” Ans. 18 (emphasis added). Appellant
does not address the Examiner’s Answer in its Reply Brief, and Appellant’s
conclusory assertions in its Appeal Brief are not persuasive of Examiner
error because they do not sufficiently explain why Park’s data for a “specific
subsystem” differs from the claimed “system description data.” Appeal Br.
13; In re Lovin, 652 F.3d at 1357.
Claim 1 also recites “instantiating, from the system description data, a
blueprint for the building-related service, the blueprint defining data
exchanges with the at least two BASs, information about target hosts, and
any dependencies to be resolved.” Appeal Br. 21 (Claims App). Appellant
argues Park’s fact database cannot be the claimed “blueprint” because it is
pre-existing and does not define any dependencies to be resolved. Appeal
Br. 13–14. Appellant construes “dependencies” as requiring one BAS to
receive input from another, Appeal Br. 14, and construes “instantiating” as
“creat[ing] an instance or a realization of that thing.” Reply Br. 9–10.
The Examiner explains that Appellant’s arguments rely on overly
narrow constructions of the terms “dependencies” and “instantiating.”

Appeal 2025-000477
Application 17/519,342
7
Ans. 18–20. The Examiner finds that Park describes dependencies in the
form of queries that “may be resolved by accessing two subsystems,” noting
that “an action by one BAS is dependent on another BAS,” even if one BAS
does not receive input from another BAS. Ans. 20 (citing Park ¶ 52). The
Examiner further finds that “nothing in the claim recites that such blueprint
cannot be pre-existing.” Ans. 18.
In its Reply, Appellant relies on extrinsic evidence to argue
“instantiating” in computer science refers to “the creation of a real instance
or particular realization of an abstraction or template, such as a class of
objects or a computer process.” Reply Br. 9–10 (quoting the “techtarget”
website). We are unpersuaded that Appellant’s extrinsic evidence supports
Appellant’s narrow construction or excludes pre-existing blueprints. The
Specification explains that “a blueprint may be instantiated from the saved
system description,” suggesting the blueprint may be instantiated from preexisting data. Spec. ¶ 87 (emphasis added). Even Appellant’s dictionary
definition suggests “instantiating” relies on a pre-existing “abstraction or
template.” Accordingly, Appellant has not shown error in the Examiner’s
construction of this challenged limitation under its broadest reasonable
interpretation.
Claim 1 further recites “building a deployment plan that includes a
sequence of steps and configurations for implementing the building-related
service” and “executing the deployment plan to implement the buildingrelated service.” Appeal Br. 21 (Claims App). Appellant argues the
Examiner merged these two “limitations into a single step of executing the
Park process.” Appeal Br. 14–15; Reply Br. 10–11.
The Examiner explains that Park’s generation of subsystem-specific
commands teaches “building a deployment plan” and that providing those

Appeal 2025-000477
Application 17/519,342
8
commands to a subsystem teaches “executing the deployment plan.” Final
Act. 12; Ans. 24–25. The Examiner maps these two claim limitations to two
separate teachings in Park. Accordingly, Appellant has not sufficiently
shown that the Examiner ignored either claim limitation or erred in mapping
them to Park.
Appellant argues that the Examiner has not shown a motivation to
combine Park and Jacobson because there is no suggestion that a
communication system in Park would benefit from Jacobson’s
individualized scheduling system. Appeal Br. 15–16. The Examiner finds
that a person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to combine the
teachings of Park and Jacobson to “allow for creating more individualized
automated scheduled events.” Final Act. 14–15 (citing Jacobson ¶¶ 3, 5,
200); Ans. 26. Jacobson explains that its invention “improve[s]
understanding and efficiency” and “provide[s] users with intuitive and easily
comprehensible programming tools to build scheduled events of a building
automation system.” Jacobson ¶ 200.
Other than characterizing Park as a communication system and
Jacobson as a scheduling system, Appellant has not sufficiently explained
why the teachings of Jacobson are incompatible with Park. The Examiner
finds, and we agree, that Appellant does “not provide any evidentiary
support as to why both systems are not combinable other than the naming
scheme of both systems.” Ans. 26. Accordingly, Appellant has not
sufficiently shown error in the Examiner’s rationale to combine the
teachings of Park and Jacobson.
In view of the foregoing, we sustain the Examiner’s rejection of
claims 1, 10, and 16.


Appeal 2025-000477
Application 17/519,342

Claims 8 and 9
Claim 8 recites “receiving from a user, via a graphical user interface
of a building automation management system tool suite, the workflow for
the frictionless entry/exit.” Appeal Br. 22 (Claims App.). Appellant argues
Ma does not teach receiving a workflow from a user or frictionless entry/exit
into a building. Appeal Br. 18.
Appellant does not sufficiently address the Examiner’s finding that
Park, not Ma, teaches receiving a workflow from a user. Final Act. 38
(citing Park ¶ 32). As to the “frictionless entry/exit” limitation, Appellant’s
assertion that Ma is limited to parking lots fails to persuasively address the
Examiner’s finding that Ma also facilities access to buildings. See Final Act.
37; Ma ¶ 75 (describing embodiments that “facilitate[] frictionless access to
a campus, building, parking lot, and/or parking space” (emphasis added)).
Claim 8 also recites “dynamically identifying, based on information in
the workflow, the at least two BASs and the set of operations and/or services
involved in executing the dynamic scheduling service to configure the
frictionless entry/exit.” Appeal Br. 22 (Claims App). Appellant asserts that
Ma does not teach “dynamically identifying at least two BASs involved in
the frictionless entry/exit” and that the only interaction between Ma’s
parking lot system and building management system involves emissions
monitoring. Appeal Br. 18–19 (citing Ma ¶ 76, Fig. 4B).
Beyond an emissions monitoring system, the Examiner finds that Ma
teaches dynamically identifying other BASs including a security system, a
lighting system, and a transportation system. Final Act. 39–40 (citing Ma
¶¶ 2, 76); Ans. 29–32 (citing Ma ¶¶ 2, 76,81, 91); see Ma ¶¶ 2 (disclosing
that a building management system (BMS) “can include, for example, an
HVAC system, a security system, a lighting system, a fire alerting system,

Appeal 2025-000477
Application 17/519,342
10
and any other system that is capable of managing building functions or
devices, or any combination thereof”), 91 (“For example, smart parking lot
system 1100 may control lights within smart parking lot 1110 to guide users
to an exit in the event of an emergency. As a further example, smart parking
lot system 1100 may control lights to illuminate a parking space assigned to
an individual.”). Appellant’s arguments are unpersuasive of Examiner error
because they do not sufficiently address these findings by the Examiner.
Claim 9 recites that the two BASs comprise
at least two of (a) an access control system to authenticate a
visitor and provide access to one or more areas of a building, (b)
HVAC system to control environmental conditions to optimize
comfort and/or air quality[,] (c) a light and blinds control system
to control lighting and operation of blinds, (d) a transportation
system or (e) external service(s)/system(s).
Appeal Br. 22 (Claims App.). Appellant asserts that Ma does not teach at
least two of the enumerated BASs. Appeal Br. 19. As explained above,
Appellant does not persuasive address the Examiner’s findings that Ma
teaches lighting system and transportation system BASs. Ans. 31–32 (citing
Ma ¶¶ 2, 76, 81, 91); see Ma ¶ 81 (disclosing “lighting control” and
“transportation management”).
Appellant argues the Examiner does not provide a rationale to
combine Park, Jacobson, and Ma because the Examiner “does not specify
which user experience” would be improved by the teachings of Ma. Appeal
Br. 19–20. Appellant’s assertions are unpersuasive of Examiner error as the
Examiner identifies multiple rationales for combining the teachings of the
prior art with evidentiary support from Ma itself. Final Act. 37; Ans. 33–34
(citing Ma ¶¶ 75, 114). Ma describes improved user experiences for
building visitors and more efficient building energy usage. Ma ¶¶ 75, 114.

Appeal 2025-000477
Application 17/519,342
11
In view of the foregoing, we sustain the Examiner’s rejections of
claims 8 and 9.
Remaining Claims
Appellant does not separately argue the rejections of the remaining
claims (2–7, 11–15, and 17–21); therefore, we sustain the rejections of these
claims.
CONCLUSION
We affirm the Examiner’s obviousness rejections of claims 1–21.
