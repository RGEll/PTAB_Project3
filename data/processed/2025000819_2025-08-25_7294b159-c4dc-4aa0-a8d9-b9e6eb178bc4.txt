CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claims on appeal are directed to a method for manufacturing a
piston ring. Claim 1, reproduced below, illustrates the claimed subject
matter:
1. A method for manufacturing a piston ring, comprising:
providing a piston ring base having an unchamfered face
surface, and a gap between two gap surfaces of the ring;
grit blasting the unchamfered face surface to create a
roughened texture having an average surface roughness Ra of
1.02-1.99 μm and Rz 6.28 to 9.05 μm, with the roughened
texture exhibiting peaks and valleys on the unchamfered face
surface;
depositing a coating on and over the roughened texture of
the face surface via physical vapor deposition, wherein the
coating is applied at a thickness of at least 10[ ]μm, and
wherein the peaks and valleys of the roughened texture on the
face surface telegraph through the coating and are visible on the
deposited coating on the face surface; and
lapping the coating to remove the peaks in the deposited
coating on the face surface without penetrating the coating, so
that the coated face surface contains plateaus from the removed
peaks, and valleys telegraphing through the coating by the
roughened texture from the grit blasting of the face surface.

OPINION
Claim 1 is directed to a piston ring that is grit blasted to a particular
average surface roughness, treated with a physical vapor deposition (PVD)
coating, and then lapped to remove the peaks of the coating on the face
surface. The Examiner rejects claim 1 in view of Herbst-Dederichs, which
teaches a piston ring that is treated with a PVD coating, and then lapped.
Final Rej. 2–4 (citing Herbst-Dederichs, 2:44–46, 2:50–52, 2:57–58). The
Examiner asserts that Herbst-Dederichs is silent as to any grit-blast pretreatment, but notes that it was known in the art to treat piston rings with grit
blasting prior to applying a coating in order to improve adhesion, citing to
Adam. Id. at 3 (citing Adam ¶¶ 45–47, 50). Further, the Examiner asserts
that Herbst-Dederichs is not clear as to the degree of lapping, but notes that
it was known in the art to lap piston ring coatings in the manner claimed in

order to reduce contact pressure, citing to Banfield. Id. at 3–4 (citing
Banfield ¶ 49). Lastly, as to the particular average surface roughness
achieved by the grit blast in Adam, when applied to the piston ring of
Herbst-Dederichs, the Examiner notes that although Adam suggests a range
of average surface roughness values using the Rz measurement similar to the
claimed range, Adam does not give the roughness value using the Ra
measurement. Id. at 3. However, the Examiner notes the two roughness
values are known in the art to be related, citing Schuetz, such that knowing
one value gives a person of ordinary skill in the art a good idea of what the
other value would come out to be (as they are simply two different ways to
describe the roughness of a given surface), and finds that Adam’s Ra range
would be generally expected to similarly overlap with the claimed range.
Id.2
Appellant argues that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not
look to the grit-blasting process of Adam when considering the piston ring of
Herbst-Dederichs, because the coating in Adam is not a PVD coating. App.
Br. 8–10. However, Adam discloses grit blasting to improve coating
adhesion on a piston ring (Adam ¶¶ 45–46), and as the Examiner states, “one
of ordinary skill would have reasonably expected success for roughening
regardless of the coating material” later applied to the piston ring. Ans. 5
(emphasis added). We agree with the Examiner on this record, who further
states that “[r]oughening a surface to enhance coating adhesion is hardly

2 Surface roughness can be measured in various ways. The most common
method in North America is Ra, which (generally speaking) averages the
heights of the peaks and valleys, whereas the most common method in
Europe is Rz, which focuses on the differences between the highest peaks
and lowest valleys. Schuetz, 1.

new.” Id. Appellant merely asserts that the coating applied in Adam is
different from the one in Herbst-Dederichs (Reply Br. 2–3), but fails to
explain why the generally understood principle of roughening a surface prior
to coating in order to improve adhesion is inapplicable here. See KSR Int’l
Co. v. Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 419 (2007) (“if a technique has been used
to improve one device, and a person of ordinary skill in the art would
recognize that it would improve similar devices in the same way, using the
technique is obvious unless its actual application is beyond his or her
skill”).3
Appellant also argues that Herbst-Dederichs “teaches away” from a
piston ring having the claimed surface roughness, citing its smoothed finish.
App. Br. 6–7. However, as the Examiner explains, the surface smoothness
values in Herbst-Dederichs are the post-treatment values (Ans. 3–4); the
claimed smoothness values are instead pre-treatment values, for which the
Examiner relies on Adam (Ans. 5). Appellant points to no disclosure of
Herbst-Dederichs that teaches away from any particular pre-treatment
surface roughness value. In re Fulton, 391 F.3d 1195, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2004)
(prior art does not teach away from claimed subject matter merely by
disclosing a different solution to a similar problem unless the prior art also
criticizes, discredits, or otherwise discourages the solution claimed).

3 For example, if the surface roughness considerations for coating adhesion
were significantly different based on whether the coating to be applied was a
resin/polymer (Adam) versus a PVD coating (Herbst-Dederichs), then
Appellant should introduce evidence in support of such an assertion for the
Examiner to consider, in the event of further prosecution. Applicant’s
present attorney argument “is not evidence and cannot rebut other admitted
evidence.” Elbit Sys. of Am., LLC v. Thales Visionix, Inc., 881 F.3d 1354,
1359 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Reviewing the record before us, we credit the Examiner’s position that it
would have been obvious to use grit blasting, as taught in Adam, as a pretreatment to the piston ring of Herbst-Dederichs, in order to improve coating
adhesion.
Appellant also argues that the pre-treatment grit blasting in Adam
does not teach the claimed Ra and Rz values. App. Br. 8–9. The Examiner
had found that Adam teaches an Rz value in the range of 3–8 μm,
significantly overlapping with the claimed Rz range of 6.28–9.05 μm. Final
Rej. 3. This aspect of the rejection is unchallenged. The Examiner cites
evidence explaining that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have
understood that the corresponding Ra range of Adam would significantly
overlap with the claimed Ra range of 1.02–1.99 μm.4 Id.; see also Ans. 5. In
particular, Schuetz teaches that, although there is not a precise mathematical
conversion between the Ra and Rz forms of measuring surface roughness, a
person of ordinary skill in the art would have expected the Rz measurement
to be about 4 to 7 times larger than the Ra measurement. Schuetz, 2.
Appellant tries to dismiss this relationship as a “rule[] of thumb” (App. Br.
8), but it is evidence regarding the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in
the art that supports the Examiner’s finding, and is not contravened by any
other evidence proffered by Appellant. Accordingly, we credit the
Examiner’s position that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have
understood Adam’s grit-blasting treatment to provide an average surface

4 The Rz lower bound of 3 μm would convert to an Ra of 0.43–0.75 μm and
the upper bound of 8 μm would convert to an Ra of 1.14–2 μm. The range
of Ra values recited in claim 1 is 1.02–1.99 μm.

roughness of 3–8 μm when measuring using Rz, or 1.14–2 μm when
measuring using Ra.
Appellant argues that “none of the prior art even mentions the base
material roughness telegraphing through the applied coating.” App. Br. 4
(emphasis removed). However, as the Examiner explains, “where the
claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in
structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially
identical processes, a prima facie case of either anticipation or obviousness
has been established.” Final Act. 4 (citing MPEP 2112.01); see In re
Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255 (CCPA 1977). Here, in both the Examiner’s
proposed combination and independent claim 1, a PVD process is applied to
a roughened surface. It is reasonable for the Examiner to conclude,
therefore, that these structures would then be substantially identical, and
Appellant offers no technical reason or evidence suggesting otherwise. In re
Spada, 911 F.2d 705, 709 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (“When the PTO shows a sound
basis for believing that the products of the applicant and the prior art are the
same, the applicant has the burden of showing that they are not.”).
Accordingly, we credit the Examiner’s position that a person of ordinary
skill in the art would have understood that the piston ring of HerbstDederichs roughened as taught in Adam would have, after the PVD process,
a surface of peaks and valleys that generally matches the shape of the pretreatment surface of peaks and valleys.
The remainder of Appellant’s arguments either argue the references in
isolation, are not directed to the claimed subject matter or the rejection
presented by the Examiner, or are not persuasive for reasons similar to those
identified above. See generally App. Br.; Reply Br.

Regarding the rejection of claims 5 and 6, because Appellant only
argues claim 1, the remaining claims fall with it. 37 C.F.R.
§ 41.37(c)(1)(iv). Further, Appellant relies on the same arguments presented
for claim 1 as the basis for seeking reversal of the remaining obviousness
rejections of claims 2–4, and 7. App. Br. 11–12. For the reasons provided
above, we do not find these arguments persuasive.
CONCLUSION
The Examiner’s decision to reject the claims is AFFIRMED.
