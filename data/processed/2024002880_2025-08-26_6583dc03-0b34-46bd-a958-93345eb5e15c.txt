CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claims are directed to methods and systems for insulated glass
units with electrical connection to internal solar panels. Claim 1, reproduced
below, illustrates the claimed subject matter:
1. An insulated glass unit (IGU) including:
a first glass lite;
a transparent solar cell formed on the first glass lite,
wherein the transparent solar cell includes one or more
busbars;
a spacer frame joined to the first glass lite and including a
corner key integrated electrical connection unit;
an electrical conductor passing through the corner key
integrated electrical connection unit, wherein:
the electrical conductor includes a molded cable and
an electrical connector joined at a bonding location
enclosed within the corner key integrated electrical
connection unit; and
the electrical conductor is electrically connected to
one of the one or more busbars; and
a second glass lite joined to the spacer frame.

OPINION
Rejections under 35 USC § 112 (a) and (b)
The Examiner finally rejected claim 25 under 35 USC § 112 (a) and
(b) as lacking written descriptive support in the Specification and as
indefinite. (Final Act. 2–4.) Appellant does not identify these rejections as
being appealed and presents no argument for their reversal. Accordingly, we
summarily affirm the rejections. See Hyatt v. Dudas, 551 F.3d 1307, 1314
(Fed. Cir. 2008) (explaining that summary affirmance without consideration
of the substantive merits is appropriate where an appellant fails to contest a
ground of rejection).

Rejections under 35 U.S.C. § 103
We review the appealed rejections for error based upon the issues
Appellant identifies, and in light of the arguments and evidence produced
thereon. Ex parte Frye, 94 USPQ2d 1072, 1075 (BPAI 2010) (precedential),
(cited with approval in In re Jung, 637 F.3d 1356, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2011)
(“[I]t has long been the Board’s practice to require an applicant to identify
the alleged error in the examiner’s rejections.”). Upon review of the
evidence and each of the respective positions set forth in the record, we find
that the preponderance of evidence supports the Examiner’s position that the
claims are obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over the cited references.
After weighing of the respective positions Appellant presents in the
Appeal Brief and the Examiner provides in the Final Office Action and the
Answer, we affirm the Examiner’s rejections of claims 1, 4–6, 21–23, and
25–32 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 essentially for the reasons the Examiner
presents. We add the following for emphasis.
Appellant argues Hammond, Chubb, and Brown do not disclose or
suggest “an electrical conductor passing through the comer key integrated
electrical connection unit, wherein: the electrical conductor includes a
molded cable and an electrical connector joined at a bonding location
enclosed within the comer key integrated electrical connection unit,” as
recited in claim 1. (Appeal Br. 15.)
Appellant argues Chubb fails to teach the electrical conductor
includes a molded cable and an electrical connector or joined at a bonding
location enclosed within the corner key integrated electrical connection unit
as required by the claimed invention. (Appeal Br. 14–15.) Appellant argues
Chubb teaches “the electrical connector 41 and wire lead 44 that are

Appeal 2024-002880
Application 16/852,175
5
detachably coupled to each other, whereas the molded cable and the
electrical connector of the pending Application are permanently bonded
with each other at a bonding location. (Appeal Br. 13.)
Appellant’s arguments are not persuasive of reversible error. As noted
by the Examiner, the Specification does not require the bond to be
permanent. (Ans. 3.) The Specification states “the molded cables and the
electrical connectors are electrically bonded, for example, using a solder
bond.” (Spec. ¶ 20.) The claim also does not require the molded cable and
electrical connector to be permanently bonded, the claim only requires
joining the molded cable and an electrical connector at a bonding location.
Chubb discloses the wire lead and the electrical connector are in electrical
contact with one another (Chubb ¶ 60.) The Examiner finds Chubb discloses
crimp electrical connectors for connecting the wire lead. (Ans. 4, Chubb ¶
15.)
Appellant further argues that Chubb is non-analogous art because the
insulating glass unit of Chubb is employed for use in refrigerated cabinets
including heating film and different from the field of insulated glass units
including solar panels. (Appeal Br. 16.)
A reference qualifies as prior art for an obviousness determination
when it is analogous to the claimed invention. Innovention Toys, LLC. v.
MGA Ent., Inc., 637 F.3d 1314, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2011). “Two separate tests
define the scope of analogous art: (1) whether the art is from the same field
of endeavor, regardless of the problem addressed, and (2) if the reference is
not within the field of the inventor's endeavor, whether the reference still is
reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor is
involved.” In re Bigio, 381 F.3d 1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The “field of

Appeal 2024-002880
Application 16/852,175
6
endeavor” test asks if the structure and function of the prior art is such that it
would be considered by a person of ordinary skill in the art because of
similarity to the structure and function of the claimed invention as disclosed
in the application. Id. at 1325–26. “A reference is reasonably pertinent if, . . .
it is one which, because of the matter with which it deals, logically would
have commended itself to an inventor's attention in considering his
problem.” In re Clay, 966 F.2d 656, 659 (Fed. Cir. 1992). “If a reference
disclosure has the same purpose as the claimed invention, the reference
relates to the same problem, and that fact supports use of that reference in an
obviousness rejection.” Id. Whether a prior art reference is “analogous” is a
question of fact. Id. at 658.
Chubb describes a corner key assembly of an insulating glass unit.
(Chubb, Abstract and ¶ 2). Chubb is analogous art because the reference is
from the same field of endeavor related to insulated glass units, where the
electrical connections utilize a corner key assembly that allows the use of
highly automated manufacturing equipment for making IG units (Chubb ¶¶
24, 25.) The use of a corner key allows the attachment of wire leads after the
essentially complete assembly of the insulating glass unit without having
wire leads interfering with the assembly or transport process. Thus, Chubb
constitutes analogous art that falls with the scope and content of the prior art
for purposes of the Examiner's obviousness analysis.
Appellant’s arguments addressing Brown and Nagao are not
persuasive. Appellant’s arguments do not address the reasons the Examiner
cited these references. (Appeal Br. 16–17.) Accordingly, Appellant has not
persuasively identified error in the Examiner’s position. See In re Lovin, 652
F.3d 1349, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2011).

Regarding the separate rejections of claims 4, 5, 6, 21–23, and 32
under 35 U.S.C. § 103, we affirm these rejections advanced by the
Examiner. Appellant has only presented arguments as to independent claim
1 and dependent claims 26–31 (discussed above) and have not otherwise
presented separate arguments on the merits for claims 4, 5, 6, 21–23, and 32.
In this regard, Appellant does not assert non-obviousness based on the
additional limitations set forth in claims 4, 5, 6, 21–23, and 32 and therefore
has failed to establish the obviousness of the additional features recited in
these separately rejected claims. Because we do not find Appellant’s
arguments persuasive as to independent claim 1, it follows that these
arguments are unpersuasive as to claims 4, 5, 6, 21–23, and 32.
CONCLUSION
The Examiner’s rejections are AFFIRMED.
