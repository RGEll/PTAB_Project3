CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claims are directed to methods and devices for capturing images
of items and, in particular, capturing item images for insertion into item
display pages. See Spec. ¶ 1.
Claim 1, reproduced below, illustrates the claimed subject matter:
1. A computer-implemented method for capturing product images
for online retail using a mobile device having a camera, the method
comprising:
retrieving an item record for a product item from memory, the item
record including data regarding the product item;
displaying a product item display page for online retail of the
product item in an online merchant store, the product item
display page having a defined layout and graphical elements set
by a theme selected for the online merchant store, including a
designated portion defined for display of an image of the
product item and one or more item detail areas displaying the
data regarding the product item from the item record for the
product item;
obtaining a real-time live stream of images from the camera
showing the product item;
processing the live stream from the camera to create a processed
live stream showing the product item;
displaying the processed live stream showing a real-time view of
the product item displayed within the designated portion in the
product item display page; and
storing a processed image for the product item in association with
the item record for the product item.

2 Yang was filed on April 15, 2022, as a continuation of a US application

OPINION
The specification describes how “[a]n inventory item record may
contain details regarding the physical item, including its name or label and
other details regarding the item” and that “[t]here may be an image or
images of the physical item stored in the inventory item record or in
association with the inventory item record.” Spec. ¶ 2. The specification
further explains that “[i]t can be time-consuming, wasteful of computing
resources, and frustrating for users to capture an image of an item, attempt
editing of the image, upload the image for use in developing an item display
page only to find the image is unsuitable, and then reattempt to capture a
suitable image, iteratively.” Id. ¶ 3.
To address these issues, the specification further describes “a
computer-implemented method for capturing product images for online
retail using a mobile device having a camera.” Spec. ¶ 13. The method
includes (a) “obtaining a product item display page for a product item,”
where “the product item display page [has] a designated portion defined for
display of an image of the product item,” (b) “obtaining a real-time live
stream of images from the camera,” (c) “processing the live stream from the
camera to create a processed live stream,” (d) “displaying the product item
display page with the processed live stream displayed within the designated

Appeal 2024-003965
Application 17/009,855
5
portion,” and (e) “storing a processed image for the product item in
association with an item record for the product item.” Id.
For independent claims 1, 11, and 21, the Final Action first combines
Zverina and Yang, citing various passages of the two references as
apparently satisfying each of the claim limitations, but not specifically
identifying which reference is relied upon for each limitation, without
providing an explanation of how the references would be combined, and
without identifying a motivation to make the combination. See Final Act.
14–22. The Final Action then adds Barkas for “a theme selected for the
online merchant store.” Id. at 23.
The Final Action next turns to Piramuthu and Stansell and returns to
the “displaying a product item display page” limitation, citing passages from
both references, and asserting that it “would have been obvious . . . to have
customized the color/style of the virtual shelves as well as the layout of the
items on the virtual shelves according to the categories of the items” and “to
have configured the look and feel of the virtual shelves according to the user
preferences.” Final Act. 23–25. The Examiner then cites Piramuthu for the
“processing the live stream,” “displaying the processed live stream,” and
“storing a processed image” limitations, but fails to explain how those
citations relate to the portions of Zverina and Yang previously cited for
those same limitations, and fails to explain how or why the teachings would
be combined. Id. at 25–28.
Appellant argues that the rejections are “deficient in presenting a
prima facie case of obviousness” because they do not provide “clear findings
of fact, supported by evidence in the form of prior art documents, and to
provide a reasoned explanation as to why a person of ordinary skill in the art

Appeal 2024-003965
Application 17/009,855
6
would have found the claimed invention obvious.” Appeal Br. 9 (citing
MPEP 2143). We agree, because we are unable to discern from the Final
Action which portions of which references are relied upon for the various
limitations and what might have motivated one of ordinary skill in the art to
combine this prior art to realize the claimed subject matter, suggesting that
hindsight may have been involved. See In re Warner, 379 F.2d 1011, 1017
(CCPA 1967) (“The Patent Office has the initial duty of supplying the
factual basis for its rejection” and “may not . . . resort to speculation,
unfounded assumptions or hindsight reconstruction to supply deficiencies in
its factual basis.”); 37 C.F.R. § 1.104(c)(2) (“The pertinence of each
reference, if not apparent, must be clearly explained.”).
Moreover, beyond the lack of clarity in the Final Action, we fail to see
how these references might be combined to result in the claimed invention.
As noted above, Appellant’s claims are generally directed to a system that
retrieves a record for an item, displays a product display page for online
retail of the product in an online merchant store, obtains a real-time live
stream of images from the camera showing the product, creates a processed
live stream showing the product, displays the processed live stream showing
a real-time view of the product displayed within the designated portion in
the product display page, and stores a processed image for the product in
association with the record for the product item. Essentially, the product
display page is shown and a processed live stream showing the product is
displayed in real time in the product display page.
Zverina describes a system “to identify one or more of a store or a
product depicted in a live stream video,” where “[a]n advertisement
associated with the store or the product can be generated [and] inserted into

Appeal 2024-003965
Application 17/009,855
7
the live stream video.” Zverina ¶ 4. Yang similarly discloses a method for
“displaying a live stream image, the live stream image comprising a live
stream host performing in a live stream environment and at least one item
located in the live stream environment” and, “in response to an item
recognition operation, displaying an item tag corresponding to the at least
one item.” Yang ¶¶ 8–9. Neither reference seems particularly pertinent to
the claimed method of displaying a product item display page and displaying
a processed live stream showing a real-time view of the product item within
a designated portion in the product item display page.
As Appellant acknowledges, Piramuthu “is aimed at a similar problem
as the present application.” Appeal Br. 16. However, we agree with
Appellant that Piramuthu differs from Appellant’s method in that it does not
display a product item webpage for online retail of the product item in an
online merchant store, including a designated portion defined for display of
an image of the product item, and display a processed live stream showing a
real-time view of the product item within the designated portion in the
product item display page. Instead, Piramuthu describes generating an item
listing using information inferred from an image during a guided image
capture. See Piramuthu ¶ 31. The system completes an item listing form,
which is then used to display the item “within an augmented reality
environment of a seller’s online store.” Id. We do not agree that either the
unfilled listing form or the augmented virtuality shelves are reasonably
equated to the claimed “product item webpage.”
For these reasons, we do not sustain the rejection of independent
claims 1, 11, and 21, or their dependent claims 2–10, 12–20, and 22.
