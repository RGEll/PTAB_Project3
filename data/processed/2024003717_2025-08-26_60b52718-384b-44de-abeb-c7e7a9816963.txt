Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 134(a), Appellant1 appeals from the
Examiner’s decision to reject claims 1–20, which constitute all pending
claims in the application. See Final Act. 1. We have jurisdiction under
35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We AFFIRM.

1 “Appellant” refers to “applicant” as defined in 37 C.F.R. § 1.42. Appellant
identifies the real party in interest as International Business Machines
Corporation. Appeal Br. 2.

CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claims are directed to a comprehensive real estate tracking system
having security features. Claim 1, reproduced below, illustrates the claimed
subject matter:
1. A computer implemented method in a data processing system
comprising a processor and a memory comprising instructions,
which are executed by the processor, causing the processor to
implement a method for tracking real estate property
information, the method comprising:
receiving, at a first computing device, first real estate
property information;
identifying a real estate immutable record, comprising
history information stored in a first blockchain that comprises a
series of blocks that each contain a cryptographic hash of a
previous block and transaction information, based on the first
real estate property information;
updating the history information in the blockchain of the
real estate immutable record with the first real estate property
information;
creating a first transaction tag associated with updating
the real estate immutable record;
distributing the first transaction tag to a plurality of
second computing devices;
providing the real estate immutable record to a cognitive
advisor system; and
determining, by the cognitive advisor system, a match
between the real estate immutable record and a buyer based on
a buyer immutable record stored in a buyer blockchain
associated with the buyer and a buyer need profile, wherein the
history information of the first blockchain comprises
information describing at least one of repair history, services
history, insurance history, governmental impact history, and
environmental history

REJECTIONS
The Examiner maintains the following rejections:
Claim(s) Rejected 35 U.S.C. § Reference(s)/ Basis
1, 4–8, 11–20 103 Howie, Davison, Wang
2, 3, 9, 10 103 Howie, Davison, Wang, Sher
OPINION
Independent claims 1, 8, and 15 and dependent claims 4–7, 11–14, and 16–
20
In contesting the rejection of independent claims 1, 8, and 15 as
unpatentable over Howie, Davison, and Wang, Appellant only argues that
Howie, on which the Examiner relies, fails to disclose “receiving . . . first
real estate property information” because “‘recording’ real estate
information on [a] distributed ledger, as allegedly taught by Howie, is
different from ‘receiving’ real estate information.” Appeal Br. 8. In
particular, Appellant argues that Howie teaches using the user computational
device 102 to receive user commands and display information to the user
instead of receiving real estate information. Id. (citing Howie ¶¶ 66, 69).
The Examiner disagrees because Howie does not only teach that the
user computational device receives user commands but paragraph 68 of

Appeal 2024-003717
Application 16/903,012
4
“Howie clarifies [that] the user interface in the user computational device
allows a customer to input commands and data.” Id.
We are not persuaded by Appellant’s argument.
Howie is directed to a distributed ledger based system and method for
the settlement and transfer of title to real estate “for management of parcel
title through a distributed ledger.” Howie ¶ 1. By using blockchain
technology to securely store and manage real estate property ownership and
parcel boundaries, Howie’s invention addresses shortcomings in existing
real estate systems that fail to provide a reliable and computational way to
determine parcel boundaries especially when multiple units within the same
parcel are owned by different entities. Id. ¶¶ 3–10. “User computational
device 102 operates user interface 108 for receiving one or more user
commands and for displaying information to the user.” Id. ¶ 66. Indeed,
paragraph 68 of Howie expressly discloses that “[t]he user interface employs
certain input and output devices to input data received from a user or output
data to a user,” which in the context of the invention requires real estate
information such as property/parcel coordinates. Id. ¶ 69. We disagree that
“Howie does not teach that the ‘commands and data’ input by a customer is
real estate information.” Reply Br. 3. For example, Figure 14 of Howie
shows the step of receiving real estate property information because a real
estate parcel “title to be searched is received at 1402” and “[t]he title
information may for example relate to a traditional mailing or physical
address” (Howie ¶ 163). See also Howie Figure 15 (1504) (“property details
are preferably provided online”).

Accordingly, we sustain the rejection of claims 1, 8, and 15 and
remaining dependent claims 4–7, 11–14, and 16–20, which are not argued
separately.
Dependent claims 2, 3, 9, and 10
With respect to dependent claims 3 and 10, Appellant argues that
Sher, on which the Examiner relies, does not teach a buyer immutable record
that comprises a purchase history because Sher relates to renters and renters
are different than buyers. Appeal Br. 9 (“Buyers purchase ownership of the
real estate property through purchase payment while renters rent to use the
real estate property through rental payment.”).
The Examiner “disagrees Sher only relates to renters because Sher
explicitly involves buyers. Specifically, ¶[0025] of Sher states the disclosure
involves ‘…renter conversion to buyer, tenant conversion to buyer…’ Thus
Sher does not only relate to renters because Sher explicitly contemplates the
renters becoming buyers.” Ans. 4–5.
We are not persuaded by Appellant’s argument.
Sher “relates to a decentralized cryptographic real estate transaction
assistance system and method for “facilitating matching, engaging,
contracting, and communicating between parties to a real estate and/or
property rental transaction by a decentralized system.” Sher ¶ 2. As the
Examiner points out, Sher is not limited to renters because paragraph 25
discusses “renter conversion to buyer” and “tenant conversion to buyer.” See
Sher ¶ 291 (“Same may be applied to use in real estate buy/sell transactions
as renters transition to becoming homebuyers, car buyers, etc.”).
Paragraph 65 of Sher discloses that real estate transactions “include[]
buying, selling, trading, transferring, and other transactional activities” and

Appeal 2024-003717
Application 16/903,012
6
that “[i]n applications relating [to] the sale of real property, the landlord term
may be substituted with seller and the renter term may be substituted with
buyer.” Moreover, Sher discloses:
In an example of a decentralized cryptographic platform
for real estate transaction assistance enabled by this disclosure,
the blockchain may include data relating to renters, tenants,
landlords, owners, buyers, sellers, agents, brokers, and other
parties related to a real estate transaction. The blockchain may
additionally include information related to rental units,
apartments, condominiums, houses, commercial real estate, and
other properties that may be bought, sold, rented, leased, or
otherwise possessed by a party.

Sher ¶ 282.
For these reasons, we are not apprised of Examiner error and sustain
the rejection of dependent claims 3 and 10. We also sustain the rejection of
dependent claims 2 and 9, which are not argued separately.
CONCLUSION
The Examiner’s rejections are AFFIRMED.
