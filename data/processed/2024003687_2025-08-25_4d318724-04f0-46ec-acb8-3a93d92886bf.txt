II. REJECTIONS
On appeal, the Examiner maintains the following rejections:
1. Claims 1–5, 9, 10, and 13–15 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as
unpatentable over the combination of Zeller,2 Bohan,3 Confer,4 and
Yamagami.5 Final Act. 2.
2. Claim 22 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as unpatentable over the
combination of Zeller, Bohan, Confer, Yamagami, and Shirai.6 Final Act.
13.
III. DISCUSSION
We review the appealed rejections for error based upon the issues
identified by Appellant and in light of the arguments and evidence produced
thereon. Cf. Ex parte Frye, 94 USPQ2d 1072, 1075 (BPAI 2010)
(precedential) (cited with approval in In re Jung, 637 F.3d 1356, 1365 (Fed.
Cir. 2011) (“[I]t has long been the Board’s practice to require an applicant to
identify the alleged error in the examiner’s rejections . . . .”)).
Upon consideration of the appeal record and each of Appellant’s
contentions, we determine that Appellant has not identified reversible error
in the Examiner’s rejections. Accordingly, we sustain the rejections
substantially based on the fact findings and for the reasons expressed by the

Examiner in the Final Office Action and Examiner’s Answer. We add the
following for emphasis.
A. Rejection of claims 1–5, 9, 10, and 13–15 over the combination of
Zeller, Bohan, Confer, and Yamagami
Claims 1 and 13 are independent. See Appeal Br. 8–12. Appellant
does not present separate arguments for the patentability of any of the
dependent claims but states that the dependent claims are allowable for the
same reasons that the independent claims are allowable. Id. at 7.
Furthermore, Appellant does not distinguish between claims 1 and 13 in its
arguments for reversal of the rejection of each of these claims. Id. at 5–7.
In view of the foregoing, we limit our discussion to claim 1 with the
understanding that our reasoning applies equally to the rejection of claim 13.
Appellant argues that the rejection of claim 1 should be reversed for
either of two reasons. Id. We address each argument in turn.
First, Appellant argues that the rejection of claim 1 should be reversed
because the combination of Zeller, Bohan, Confer, and Yamagami does not
describe or suggest each of claim 1’s limitations. Appeal Br. 5–6. In the
relevant part, claim 1 recites “an electrical tab . . . the electrical tab is
connected to the first cylindrical cell and the second cylindrical cell using
spot welding.” Id. at 8 (emphasis added). Appellant argues that the Examiner
reversibly erred by finding that Zeller’s paragraph 39 describes or suggests
this limitation. Id. at 5–6.
We are not persuaded by this argument.
In the Final Action, the Examiner found that Zeller’s paragraph 39
describes structure that corresponds to the recited electrical tab and which
may be welded to the first and second battery cells. Final Act. 3. Spot

Application 16/929,534

welding is one type of welding and has advantages relative to other types of
welding—e.g., arc-welding—in some circumstances. In the Answer, the
Examiner explained that a person having ordinary skill in the art would have
known that bonding connector elements such as electrical tabs to battery
cells is one such situation. Ans. 15–16.7
We do not discern reversible error in the Examiner’s findings and
reasoning.
Second, Appellant argues that the rejection of claim 1 should be
reversed because at least one applied reference, Confer, is not analogous art.
Appeal Br. 6–7.
We are not persuaded by this argument.
For a reference to be used as part of an obviousness rejection of
Appellant’s claims, the reference must be analogous art to the claimed
invention. In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 986‒87 (Fed. Cir. 2006). A reference is
analogous if it is either (1) in the field of the inventor’s endeavor or
(2) reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor
was concerned. Id.
For the following reasons, we agree with the Examiner that Confer is
within the inventors’ field of endeavor. See Answer. 16–17.
As an initial matter, we disagree with Appellant’s characterization of
the nature of the claimed invention. Appellant argues that “[t]he claimed
invention is directed to ‘electrical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.’”
Appeal Br. 6 (citing Spec. ¶ 19). Claim 1, however, does not recite any
limitations incorporating an eVTOL vehicle or making the claimed battery

system uniquely suitable for use in such vehicles. As currently written, claim
1 is directed to a “battery system” in general.
We begin our determination of the inventors’ field of endeavor by
referring to the ’534 Application’s Specification. See In re Mettke, 570 F.3d
1356, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (relying on specification to determine
applicant’s field of endeavor). The Specification is focused on components
for use in eVTOL vehicles. See, e.g., Spec. ¶¶ 1, 19.
We, however, do not consider the field of endeavor to be restricted
solely to eVTOL vehicles. The scope of analogous art is construed broadly.
Wyers v. Master Lock Co., 616 F.3d 1231, 1238 (Fed. Cir. 2010).
Battery systems used in electric vehicles of any type face a common
set of criteria including the battery size, weight, reliability, charging speed,
etc. While the relative importance of these criteria varies according to the
specific vehicle type, improvements in battery systems for one or of electric
vehicle very likely are equal to battery systems in other types of electric
vehicles. In view of these common factors, we identify the Inventors’ field
of endeavor as battery systems for use in electric vehicles. Cf. In re
Deminski, 796 F.2d 436, 442 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (determining that the cited
references were in the same field of endeavor where they “have essentially
the same function and structure” as the claimed apparatus).
Confer describes battery systems used in industrial material handling
vehicles. Confer ¶¶ 3–13. Thus, the Examiner did not reversibly err by
finding that Confer is analogous art and may be used in an obviousness
rejection of the claimed invention.

B. Rejection of claim 22 over the combination of Zeller, Bohan, Confer,
Yamagami, and Shirai
Claim 22 depends from claim 1. Appeal Br. 12. Appellant does not
present separate arguments for reversal of the rejection of claim 22. Id. at 7.
Instead, Appellant argues that the rejection of claim 22 should be reversed
based on the arguments Appellant presented for reversal of the rejection of
claim 1. Id.
Because we have affirmed the rejection of claim 1, we also affirm the
rejection of claim 22.
