DECISION ON APPEAL
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 134(a), Appellant1 appeals from the
Examiner’s decision to reject claims 31–33. See Final Act. 1. We have
jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b).
We REVERSE.

1 “Appellant” refers to “applicant” as defined in 37 C.F.R. § 1.42. Appellant
identifies the real party in interest as Hilti Aktiengesellschaft. Appeal Br. 2.

CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER
The claims are directed to a safety device for battery packs having
pouch cells. Claim 31, reproduced below with emphasis added to a recitation
key to this appeal, illustrates the claimed subject matter:
31. A rechargeable battery pack comprising:
at least one pouch cell defining a top surface and a
bottom surface; and
an electrical circuit with at least one interrupter designed
to at least temporarily interrupt a current draw from the pouch
cell or from the rechargeable battery pack, the interrupter
tripped by an expansion of the pouch cell;
the interrupter being designed as a mechanical switch or
button;
the electrical circuit fully surrounding a cross section of
the at least one pouch cell so as to encircle the top surface and
the bottom surface.
Appeal Br. 6 (Claims App.)
REFERENCE
The Examiner relies on the following references to reject the claims:
Name Reference Date
Roh US 2014/0248523 A1 Sept. 4, 2014
REJECTION
The Examiner maintains the rejection of claims 31–33 under 35
U.S.C. § 102 as being anticipated by Roh. Final Act. 3.
OPINION
The Examiner determines that Roh anticipates claim 31. Final Act. 3.
With respect to the final recitation of claim 31, the Examiner finds that
Figure 10 of Roh teaches “the electrical circuit fully surrounding a cross
section of the at least one pouch cell so as to encircle the top surface and the
bottom surface.” Id. Appellant argues that Roh does not teach an electrical

3
circuit that fully surrounds a cross section of the at least one pouch cell so as
to encircle the top surface and bottom surface. Appeal Br. 4. Appellant’s
argument persuades us of Examiner error for the reasons we explain below.
As a threshold matter, we agree with Appellant that Appellant’s
Specification explains operation of its device differently than the explanation
Roh provides for the Roh device. Reply Br. 2. Appellant’s Specification
explains that, when battery cells expand, the fusible link will narrow.
Spec.¶ 34. The narrowing will create a higher current that causes the fusible
link to melt. Id. As the pouch cells expand further, the fusible link breaks
mechanically. Id. ¶ 35; see also id. at Figs. 3A, 3B, 3B´.
Roh’s explanation of its device is less clear. Roh explains that an
“expansion force is transmitted to the circuit breaker 500 located at the side
of the outermost battery module.” Roh ¶ 93. Roh explains that “[h]igh
electric current flows in the electrical connection circuit 801 of the battery
pack 700” results in breaking cut-off portion 800. Id. ¶ 94. While evaluation
of the Examiner’s rejection does not squarely hinge on the distinction
between the Specification’s and Roh’s description of their devices’ function,
the distinction does, somewhat, weigh against interpreting any ambiguity in
favor of Roh having the same structure as claim 31.
With this context in mind, we consider Appellant’s argument that Roh
Figure 10 does not adequately establish an “electrical circuit fully
surrounding a cross section of the at least one pouch cell so as to encircle the
top surface and the bottom surface” as claim 31 recites. Appeal Br. 4. In
particular, Appellant argues that Figure 10 is a schematic. Id.
We agree with Appellant that Roh Figure 10 is, at least in part, a
schematic. We reproduce Roh Figure 10 below.

Roh describes Figure 10 as “a view showing circuitry of the battery pack
according to an embodiment of the present description.” Roh ¶ 60. From this
text, it is not clear whether Figure 10 is intended to be a schematic or not.
On inspection, Figure 10 appears to be at least partially a schematic. Figure
10 depicts what a battery pack and terminals could actually look like in the
real world (for example, anode terminal 306, cathode conduction part 561,
anode conduction part 562, and battery module 301). Id. ¶¶ 91–94. Figure 10
also, however, presents abstract symbols rather than a real-world depiction
to show, for example, HV Fuse 800 and, importantly, electrical connection
circuit 801. The HV Fuse 800 is instead represented as a rectangle, and the
electrical connection circuit 801 is represented by a line that turns at
perfectly square 90° corners as in a schematic.

Application 17/058,901
5
Because Figure 10 appears to be a schematic in its depiction of the
electrical connection circuit 801, we do not understand Roh as necessarily
teaching that the circuit must be located such that it would “surround[] a
cross section of the at least one pouch cell so as to encircle the top surface
and the bottom surface” as claim 31 recites. Rather, to the extent the
depiction of electrical connection circuit 801 is a schematic, Roh only
teaches what points should be electrically connected rather than how the
wiring should be physically arranged in the real-world. Also, because Roh
describes the functional operation of its device differently than how
Appellant’s Specification describes the operation of its device, consideration
of the devices’ operation does not resolve any ambiguity.
Because Roh’s teachings are unclear as explained above, we do not
sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claim 31. We also do not sustain the
rejection of claims 32 and 33 because those claims depend from claim 31,
and the Examiner’s treatment of those claims does not cure the error with
respect to claim 31.
CONCLUSION
The Examiner’s rejection is REVERSED.
