IV. ISSUES AND ANALYSES
We review appealed rejections for reversible error based on the
arguments and evidence Appellant provides for each issue Appellant
identifies. 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(1)(iv); Ex parte Frye, 94 USPQ2d 1072,
1075 (BPAI 2010) (precedential) (cited with approval in In re Jung, 637
F.3d 1356, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (holding that “it has long been the Board’s
practice to require an applicant to identify the alleged error in the examiner’s
rejections”)). “After evidence or argument is submitted by the applicant in
response, patentability is determined on the totality of the record, by a
preponderance of evidence with due consideration to persuasiveness of
argument.” In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
We decline to adopt the Examiner’s findings and conclusions that the
claims are obvious over the cited prior art. We explain our reasoning below.

The Examiner’s findings and conclusions
The Examiner notes that Appellant has elected a species of the
composition of independent claim 39 for purposes of prosecution. Final Act.
2. The elected species names the following constituents:
A) one amino functional silicone-bis(C13-15 alkoxy) PGamodimethicone;
B) nonionic silicone polymerdivinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer;
C) one ampholytic polymer- polyquaternium-53;
D) at least one cationic surfactant
dipalmitoylethylhydroxyethylmonium methosulfate,
behentrimonium chloride, and cetrimonium chloride;
E) At least non-silicone fatty compound- cetyl esters, cetyl
alcohol, C14-15 alcohols, cetearyl alcohol, isotridecyl
alcohol and myristyl alcohol;

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990

F) At least one nonionic surfactant- C1rC13 Pareth-3 and
CirC13 Pareth-23;
G) Thickening agent- present: hydroxyethylcellulose;
H) At least one water-soluble solvent- isopropyl alcohol and
glycerin;
-and-
I) At least one additional component- water, preservatives,
pH adjuster and fragrance.
Id. at 2–3.
The Examiner finds that Molenda teaches aqueous hair conditioning
compositions that condition damaged and healthy hair homogeneously, such
that the conditioned hair has shine, elasticity, volume, body, and is
manageable. Final Act. 4 (citing Molenda, Abstr., ¶¶ 9, 17). The Examiner
finds that Molenda teaches that its compositions comprise an aqueous
emulsion of divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer at a concentration
of 0.01 to 10 wt%. Id. (citing Molenda ¶ 17). The Examiner also finds that
Molenda teaches that the aqueous divinyldimethicone/dimethicone
copolymer emulsion further comprises C12–13 Pareth-23 and C12–13
Pareth-3 as nonionic emulsifiers, and is sold under the trade name Dow
Corning HMW 2220. Id. (citing Molenda ¶ 18).
The Examiner finds that Molenda teaches that the conditioning
composition comprises at least one cationic polymer as a conditioning agent,
which can be polyquaternium-53, at 0.01–10 wt%. Final Act. 4 (citing
Molenda ¶¶ 23, 31). The Examiner finds that Molenda teaches that the
conditioning composition used in the method comprises one or more
cationic surfactant(s), which may be behentrimonium chloride and/or
cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (i.e., cetrimonium chloride) at a

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990
6
concentration of 0.01–10 wt%. Id. (citing Molenda ¶¶ 28, 29, 31). The
Examiner finds that Molenda further teaches that its compositions
additionally comprise at least one C8–24 fatty alcohol, which can include
myristyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol at a concentration that is
usually less than 20 wt%. Id. (citing Molenda ¶ 80).
The Examiner also finds that Molenda teaches that its composition
comprises: (1) water; (2) nonionic conditioning agents, which can include
glycerin, at 3%; (3) organic solvents, including isopropanol, at 10 wt% or
less; (4) preservatives, including ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, at 0.01–
2.5%; (5) fragrances; (6) salts including sodium chloride; and (7) pH
adjusting agents. Final Act. 4 (citing Molenda, Abstr., ¶¶ 22, 36, 38, 81, 84,
88, 128, Ex. 8–10).
The Examiner acknowledges that Molenda does not teach or suggest
the inclusion of bis-(C13–15 alkoxy) PG-amodimethicone, or the claimed
range for the concentration of water, dipalmitoylethylhydroxyethylmonium
methosulfate, cetyl esters, CIS alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, and
hydroxyethylcellulose. Final Act. 5. The Examiner further acknowledges
that Molenda neither teaches nor suggests the claimed step of “after applying
the hair conditioning composition to the hair and optionally rinsing the hair
conditioning composition from the\ hair, cleansing the hair with a shampoo.”
Id.
The Examiner therefore points to Salvador, which teaches a hair
conditioning composition comprising about 20% to about 95% water, and
about 0.01% to about 10% of a hydrophobic silicone compound. Final
Act. 5 (citing Salvador ¶¶ 43, 97). The Examiner notes that Salvador
discloses that bis-(C13–C15 alkoxy) PG amodimethicone is a commercially

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990
7
available hydrophilic silicone for use in the hair conditioner as a silicone
conditioning agent. Id. (citing Salvador ¶¶ 100, 105, 108). The Examiner
also finds that Salvador teaches that the combination of a high melting point
fatty compound, such as cetyl stearate and cetyl palmitate (i.e., cetyl esters)
at about 0.1% to about 15%, together with a cationic surfactant and an
aqueous carrier, provides a gel matrix. Id. at 5–6 (citing Salvador ¶ 86, 88,
91). The Examiner finds Salvador teaches that such a gel matrix is suitable
for providing various conditioning benefits, such as a slippery and slick feel
on wet hair, hair softness, moisturized feel, and fly-away control on dry hair.
Id.
The Examiner further finds that Salvador teaches that inclusion of a
cellulose polymer, hydroxyethyl cellulose, at about 0.001% to about 5%, is
useful in providing hair volume control benefits, while not decreasing
conditioning benefits, such as fly-away control. Id. (citing Salvador ¶¶ 46,
48, 50).
The Examiner next turns to Walker, which teaches a hair conditioning
composition comprising from about 0.1% to about 20% of one or more
unsaturated fatty materials selected from a group consisting of: (1) an
unsaturated fatty acid; (2) an unsaturated fatty alcohol; (3) an unsaturated
amine; (4) an unsaturated amide; and (5) an unsaturated phospholipid. Final
Act. 6 (citing Walker Abstr.). The Examiner finds that Walker teaches
inclusion of about 0.05% to 20% of a lipid enhancing agent, including
tridecyl alcohol (1-tridecanol, tridecanol, isotridecanol/isotridecyl alcohol),
myristyl alcohol (1-tetradecanol), pentadecyl alcohol (1-pentadecanol,
pentadecanol, i.e., C-15 alcohol), cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and cetearyl
alcohol. Id. (citing Walker ¶ 31, Tables 1–9). The Examiner finds that

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990
8
Walker defines a “lipid enhancing agent” as a material which further
improves upon the hair fiber benefit provided by the lipid, such as decreased
combing. Id. (citing Walker ¶ 24).
The Examiner then points to Bourdin, which teaches hair
compositions, preferably conditioners. Final Act. 6 (citing Bourdin, 10).
The Examiner finds that Bourdin teaches surfactants for use in its
compositions, including behenyltrimethylammonium chloride,
cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, and
dipalmitoylethylhydroxyethylammonium methosulphate at between 0.01 and
30% by weight. Id. (citing Bourdin, 4, claims 6, 7).
The Examiner finds that Parsons teaches that “the internet’s current
favorite hair hack” is the “Reverse Wash System” Final Act. 6 (quoting
Parsons, 2). The Examiner notes that Parsons states that the “Reverse Wash
System” is “a method to achieve more voluminous hair by applying
conditioner before shampoo.” Id. (quoting Parsons, 2 (emphasis in
original)). The Examiner finds that Parsons teaches that the Reverse Wash
System consists of the following steps: “1 Apply conditioner to wet hair. Let
it soak in for a minute or more. Rinse! 2 Shampoo as you would normally.
So there you have it!” Id. at 7 (quoting Parsons 3). The Examiner finds that
Parsons thus teaches applying a hair conditioner to hair immediately prior to
cleansing the hair. Id.
The Examiner finds that Parsons teaches that the Reverse Wash
System permits wide-toothed combs to easily comb through hair and that the
conditioned hair had noticeably increased volume. Final Act. 7 (citing
Parsons 5, 6). The Examiner notes that Parsons teaches that the conditioned

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990
9
hair still had volume even after heat styling, and was soft and frizz-free in
addition to having more volume. Id. (citing Parsons, 11, 15).
The Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious to a person
of ordinary skill in the art to have modified Molenda’s composition and
method by modifying the concentration of water to about 20% to about 95%,
the concentration of glycerin to 3%, and the concentration of isopropanol to
an amount exceeding 10%, and adding about 0.01% to about 10% bis-(C13–
C15 alkoxy) PG amodimethicone, about 0.1% to about 15% cetyl stearate
and cetyl palmitate (i.e., cetyl esters), 0.001% to about 5%
hydroxyethylcellulose, about 0.05% to 20% of lipid enhancing agents
including tridecyl alcohol (1-tridecanol, tridecanol, isotridecanol/isotridecyl
alcohol) and pentadecyl alcohol, and 0.01–30% by weight
dipalmitoylethylhydroxyethylammonium methosulphate, and applying the
hair conditioning composition to wet hair, letting it soak in for a minute or
more, optionally rinsing, and then shampooing, as suggested by the
combined teachings of Molenda, Salvador, Walker, Bourdin, and Parsons.
Final Act. 7.
The Examiner reasons that the prior art references are all directed to
hair conditioners which condition and volumize hair and a method to do so.
Final Act. 8. The Examiner notes that bis-(C13–C15 alkoxy) PG
amodimethicone is a hydrophilic silicone hair conditioning agent; and that
dipalmitoylethylhydroxyethylmonium methosulfate is a preferred surfactant
for hair conditioners that is functionally equivalent to Molenda’s
behentrimonium chloride and cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride hair
conditioning surfactants. Id. The Examiner also finds that cetyl stearate and
cetyl palmitate (i.e., cetyl esters) are high melting point fatty compounds

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990
10
used in hair conditioners which interact with other reagents to produce a gel
matrix to provide conditioning benefits; and that tridecyl alcohol (1tridecanol, tridecanol, isotridecanol/isotridecyl alcohol) and pentadecyl
alcohol (1-pentadecanol, pentadecanol; i.e., C-15 alcohol) are functionally
equivalent to Molenda’s fatty alcohols, all of which are taught as lipid
enhancing agents in hair conditioners. Id.
Furthermore, the Examiner reasons that hydroxyethylcellulose is
cellulose polymer used in hair conditioners to provide hair volume control
benefits while not deteriorating conditioning benefits. Id. The Examiner
reasons that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine the
references, with a reasonable expectation of success, to meet the needs of
consumers by providing a composition and method for conditioning
damaged hair which increases conditioning and decreases combing and flyaway control, while still providing noticeably increased volume. Id.

Analysis
We are not persuaded that the Examiner has satisfactorily established
a prima facie case that the claims on appeal would have been obvious over
the cited prior art.
Molenda, Salvador, Walker, and Bourdin, that are relied upon by the
Examiner as teaching the constituents, each present large numbers of
alternative constituents and/or ranges for each of those that the Examiner
relies upon. By way of example, Molenda teaches over a hundred suitable
cationic polymers in addition to the claimed polyquaternium-53, including
polyquaternium-1 through polyquaternium-87, twenty-one silicone

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990
11
quaternium species, and “polymers known with their CTFA category name
Quaternium” (e.g., 20 species listed), amongst others. Molenda ¶¶ 23–26.
The Examiner concludes that a person of ordinary skill in the art
would have found it obvious to modify the composition of Molenda, with
the teachings of Salvador, Walker, and Bourdin by:
[M]odifying the amount of water to be about 20% to about 95%,
the amount of glycerin to be 3%, and the amount of isopropanol
to an amount exceeding 10%, and adding about 0.01% to about
10% bis-(C13–C15 alkoxy) PG amodimethicone, about 0.1% to
about 15% cetyl stearate and cetyl pa lmitate (i.e. cetyl esters),
0.001 to about 5% hydroxyethylcellulose, about 0.05% to 20%of
lipid enhancing agents including tridecyl alcohol (1 -tridecanol,
tridecanol, isotridecanol/isotridecyl alcohol) and pentadecyl
alcohol (1-pentadecanol, pentadecanol; i.e. [,] 15 alcohols), and
0.01–30% by weight dipalmitoylethylhydroxyethylammonium
methosulphate.
Final Act. 7–8. The Examiner reasons that:
Bis-(C13–C15 alkoxy) PG amodimethicone is a hydrophilic
silicone hair conditioning agent; dipalmitoylethylhydroxy -
ethylmonium methosulfate is a preferred surfactant for hair
conditioners that is functionally equivalent to Molenda’s
behentrimonium chloride and cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride
hair conditioning surfactants; cetyl stearate and cetyl pa lmitate
(i.e.[,] cetyl esters) are high melting point fatty compounds used
in hair conditioners which interact with other reagents to produce
a gel matrix to provide conditioning benefits; tridecyl alcohol (1tridecanol, tridecanol, isotridecanol/isotridecyl alcohol) and
pentadecyl alcohol (1 -pentadecanol, pentadecanol; i.e. c15
alcohol) functionally equivalent to Molenda’s fatty alcohols all
of which are taught as lipid enhancing agents in hair
conditioners; and hydroxyethylcellulose is cellulose polymer
used in hair conditioners to provide hair volume control benefits
while not deteriorating conditioning benefits.
Id. at 8. The Examiner concludes that:

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990
12
With regard to the recited pH range and amounts of bis-
(C13–C15 alkoxy) PG amodimethicone/aminofunctional
silicone, divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer/nonionic
silicone polymer polyquaternium-53/ampholytic polymer,
dipalmitoylethylhydroxyethylmonium methosulfat e,
behentrimonium chloride+ cetrimonium chloride/cationic
surfactant, water, hydroxyethyl cellulose/thickening agent, fatty
alcohol/non-silicone fatty compound, glycerin+ isopropanol/
water-soluble solvent, the combined teachings Molenda,
Salvador, Walker and Bourdin suggest the parameters with
amounts that overlap or fall within the claimed range.
Id. at 8–9.
We recognize that Molenda, Salvador, Walker, and Bourdin are all
directed to hair conditioner compositions. Consequently, a mere mixing and
matching of known constituents disclosed by the various references as
components of hair conditioner compositions would likely be obvious to a
person of ordinary skill in the art if the resulting composition yields no more
than just another hair conditioner, even if drawing from amongst a diverse
possibility of alternatives. See KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398,
416 (2007) (holding that the “combination of familiar elements according to
known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield
predictable results”). In making such an obviousness determination, the
Court explained, “it will be necessary … to look to interrelated teachings of
multiple patents … and the background knowledge possessed by a person
having ordinary skill in the art, all in order to determine whether there was
an apparent reason to combine the known elements in the fashion claimed by
the patent at issue.” Id. at 418.
However, we find that there is a larger problem with the Examiner’s
rejection of the claims on appeal.

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990
13
Parsons is relied upon by the Examiner as teaching the limitations of
claim 39 reciting:
[A]pplying the hair conditioning composition to the hair before
applying a shampoo to the hair;
optionally rinsing the hair conditioning composition from the
hair;
after applying the hair conditioning composition to the hair and
optionally rinsing the hair conditioning composition from the
hair, cleansing the hair with a shampoo.
App. Br. 24 (Claims App’x).
Parsons refers to this procedure as the “Reverse Wash System.”
Parsons, 2. However, Parsons expressly cautions the reader with a
“Warning: Not all shampoo and conditioners are created for this purpose.
You’re best using a system that’s designed to work in reverse.” Id.; see also
id. at 3 (“[I]t’s recommended to use a shampoo-conditioner combo that’s
specifically formulated for this purpose [i.e., the reverse washing method]”).
Furthermore, Appellant’s Specification, and the Declaration of Dr.
Semra Senturk-Ozer (the “Senturk-Ozer Declaration”), a named inventor of
the claimed invention, disclose that hair conditioners formulated for the
reverse wash method recited in the claims were well known in the art at the
time of filing. See Spec. Ex. 2(a) (comparing results of the claimed
composition “in a reverse wash routine with a commercial benchmark
reverse wash conditioner in a home use test.”); Senturk-Ozer Decl. ¶ 9
(testifying that the commercial benchmark reverse wash conditioner used in
Example 2(a) of the Specification was TRESemmé Beauty-Full Volume
Shampoo and Conditioner, which is also disclosed by Parsons as being “a
system that’s designed to work in reverse.” Id. (citing Parsons 2–3)).

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990
14
To summarize, hair conditioners formulated to work in the claimed
reverse wash method were known in the art at the time of Appellant’s filing.
However, none of the other references cited by the Examiner (Molenda,
Salvador, Walker, or Bourdin) teach or suggest that their hair conditioner
compositions are designed or formulated for a reverse wash method
application. For example, Molenda teaches that “[t]he compositions of the
present invention can be either a conditioning-cleansing compositionshampoo or a conditioning composition typically used after use of cleansing
compositions.” Molenda ¶ 14. Molenda further teaches that, for an
exemplary embodiment “[t]he above composition was used as a leave-in
conditioner from a pump spray bottle on damaged hair which was freshly
washed and towel-dried. In dry state it was observed that hair was easily
comb[-]able, had elasticity, volume and body.” Id. ¶ 97; see also id. ¶ 99
(same).
Similarly, Salvador teaches that:
Although some consumers prefer the ease and
convenience of a shampoo which includes conditioners, a
substantial proportion of consumers prefer the more
conventional conditioner formulations which are applied to the
hair as a separate step from shampooing, usually subsequent to
shampooing. Conditioning formulations can be in the form of
rinse-off products or leave -on products, and can be in the form
of an emulsion, cream, gel, spray, and mousse.
Salvador ¶ 6. And Walker teaches that:
The most common hair care rinse -off compositions are
shampoos and rinse -off conditioners. Shampoos contain
detersive surfactants and they are used for cleansing hair, while
rinse-off conditioners are typically used after shampoo, they are
substantially free of detersive surfactants, they contain
conditioning agents to improve hair feel, reverse hair damage and
protect against further damage.

Appeal 2025-000420
Application 15/859,990
15
Walker ¶ 15.
None of the references cited by the Examiner teach or suggest that
their compositions are formulated, or suitable, for application in the reverse
wash system recited in the claims. The Examiner has therefore not
established a nexus between the commercially-available reverse wash
systems that were known in the art, as taught by Parsons, and the
compositions of Molenda, Salvador, Walker, or Bourdin, which do not teach
or suggest that their compositions are suitable for that method. In other
words, the Examiner has not established a reason why a person of ordinary
skill in the art would have been motivated, with a reasonable expectation of
success, to combine the teachings of Molenda, Salvador, Walker, and
Bourdin to arrive at a hair conditioner composition that could be used in the
claimed reverse-wash manner. This is especially so in view of the teachings
of Parsons, cautioning the viewer against using hair conditioners not
specially formulated for the reverse wash method.
Because we find that the Examiner has thus failed to establish a prima
facie case that the claims are obvious over the cited prior art, we reverse the
Examiner’s rejection of independent claims 39 and 44. Furthermore,
because dependent claims 40–43 and 45 depend from the independent
claims, we similarly reverse the Examiner’s rejection of those claims.

V. CONCLUSION
The rejection of claims 39–45 as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103
is reversed.
