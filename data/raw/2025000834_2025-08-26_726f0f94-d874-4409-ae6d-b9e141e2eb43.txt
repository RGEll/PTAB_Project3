CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER 
The subject matter relates to techniques for analyzing content.  Spec. 
¶ 2.  The Specification describes the invention as follows: 
A content stream (e.g., video stream) may be generated based on 
source content (e.g., a video file).  Imaging analysis may be used 
to detect scenes, scene boundaries, and/or scene durations of the 
content stream.  Scenes identified in the content stream may be 
compared with scenes associated with the source  content. 
Transformation and other variations in content quality may result 
in scene detection in  the video stream that is inconsistent with 
the scenes associated with the source file.  A matching process 
may be used that includes modifying scene boundaries 
associated with the source  content.  Multiple scenes may be 
merged as a single scene, and the merged scene may be compared 
with detected scenes of the video stream.  The matching process 
may be iterative to  allow for multiple rounds of scene 
modification and comparison.  Results of the matching process  
may be used to generate analytics, send notifications, cause 
actions to be performed, or a combination thereof. 
Id. 
Claim 1, reproduced below, illustrates the claimed subject matter: 
1. A method comprising: 
 comparing first scene boundaries associated with a video 
stream and second scene boundaries associated with a source 
video used to generate the video stream; 
 determining, based on the comparing, a mismatch 
between the first scene boundaries and the second scene 
boundaries; 
 determining, based on the determining the mismatch and 
by removing one or more of the second scene boundaries, 
modified second scene boundaries; 
 determining, based on comparing the first scene 
boundaries and the modified second scene boundaries, a match 
or a mismatch; and

 processing, based on the match or the mismatch, the 
video stream. 
REFERENCES 
The Examiner relies on the following references to reject the claims: 
Name Reference Date 
 Catalano  US 10,789,990 B2  Sept. 29, 2020 
 Zhao  US 2019/0294887 A1  Sept. 26, 2019 
 
REJECTIONS 
1. Claims 1–6, 21–26, 28–33, and 35–40 stand rejected under 35 
U.S.C. § 102(a)(1) as anticipated by Zhao.  Final Act. 5–7. 
2. Claims 7, 27, 34, and 41 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 
as unpatentable over Zhao and Catalano.  Final Act. 8–9. 
OPINION 
REJECTION UNDER 35 U.S.C. § 102 
Independent Claims 1, 21, 28, and 35 
Claim 1 recites “comparing first scene boundaries associated with a 
video stream and second scene boundaries associated with a source video 
used to generate the video stream.”  Appeal Br. 14 (Claims App.).  Claims 
21, 28, and 35 each recite commensurate limitations.  Id. at 15, 17, 18. 
The Examiner finds Zhao teaches the aforementioned limitation.  
Final Act. 5 (citing Zhao ¶¶ 36, 45, 51–53, FIG. 3).  Zhao describes 
receiving image/video output from a special electronic device such as digital 
camera, video camera and/or network camera and acquiring a current video 
frame from the received video (i.e., the input video).  Zhao ¶¶ 36, 45, 51, 
FIG. 3 (S310).  Zhao also describes acquiring a scene model, which is 

Appeal 2025-000834 
Application 17/231,864

obtained based on the current video frame and the previous video frame of 
the current video frame.  Id. ¶¶ 45, 52, FIG. 3 (S320).  Zhao further 
describes determining whether a visual element model in the scene model is 
the “matched visual element model” or the “unmatched visual element 
model” based on the difference between the appearance feature of the visual 
element model and appearance feature of visual element in the video frame 
corresponding to the visual element model.  Id. ¶ 53, FIG. 3 (S330).  For 
example, Zhou looks to the similarity between the texture feature/color 
feature/illumination feature of the visual element model and the texture 
feature/color feature/illumination feature of visual element corresponding to 
the visual element model.  Id. ¶ 53.  According to Zhao, if the determined 
similarity is equal to or greater than a predefined threshold value, the visual 
element model is determined as the “matched visual element model,” and if 
not, the visual element model is determined as the “unmatched visual 
element model.”  Id. 
Appellant argues that “Zhao is completely unrelated to comparing any 
kind of data associated with a video stream and data associated with a source 
video used to generate the video stream.”  Appeal Br. 4.  Appellant argues 
that “[i]ndeed, there is never a discussion in Zhao of both a video stream and 
a source video used to generate the video stream on the same device that 
does the foreground processing.”  Id. at 5.  Appellant argues that in Zhao, 
“[t]here is only the simple input of a single video, and that video is 
processed (without generating a new video stream) to detect foreground.”  
Id. at 6.  
We are persuaded of Examiner error by Appellant’s arguments.  “A 
claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is

Application 17/231,864 
5 
found, either expressly or inherently described, in a single prior art 
reference.”  Verdegaal Bros., Inc. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 814 F.2d 628, 
631 (Fed. Cir. 1987).  Claim 1 recites “comparing first scene boundaries 
associated with a video stream and second scene boundaries associated with 
a source video used to generate the video stream,” but we do not discern 
from the relied upon portions of Zhao that Zhao discloses comparing both 
the video stream and source video used to generate the video stream.  
Appeal Br. 14 (Claim App.) (emphasis added).  As Appellant points out, the 
“t-th video frame” described in Zhao “is not a ‘video stream’ at all, but a 
single frame.”  Appeal Br. 7.  The Examiner’s rejection does not provide 
sufficient evidence or reasoning why Zhao’s description of acquiring a 
current video frame from the received input video and a scene model 
obtained based on the current video frame and the previous video frame 
discloses the claimed video stream generated by a source video.   
Accordingly, we do not agree that Zhao anticipates claim 1 and we do 
not sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a)(1).  
We also do not sustain the rejection of independent claims 21, 28, and 35, 
which recite similar limitations and were rejected under the same basis.  See 
Final Act. 7.  Finally, we do not sustain the rejection of claims 2–6, 22–26, 
29–33, and 36–40 because they depend from one of claims 1, 21, 28, or 35. 
REJECTION UNDER 35 U.S.C. § 103 
Claims 7, 27, 34, and 41 
Claim 7 depends from claim 1 and further recites “comparing the first 
scene boundaries of the video stream and the second scene boundaries 
associated with the source video used to generate the video stream comprises 
comparing scene start times and scene durations of the second scene 

Appeal 2025-000834 
Application 17/231,864 
6 
boundaries with scene start times and scene durations of the first scene 
boundaries.”  Appeal Br. 15 (Claims App.).  Claim 27 depending from claim 
21, claim 34 depending from claim 28, and claim 41 depending from claim 
35 each recite commensurate limitations.  Id. at 17, 18, 20.   
The Examiner rejected claims 7, 27, 34, and 41 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 
as unpatentable over Zhao and Catalano.  Final Act. 8–9.  The Examiner 
does not rely on Catalano to remedy the deficiencies in Zhao with respect to 
the independent claims discussed above.  Accordingly, we do not sustain the 
Examiner’s obviousness rejection of claims 7, 27, 34, and 41 for the same 
reasons given for the independent claims from which they depend. 
CONCLUSION 
The Examiner’s rejections are REVERSED.
