I. INTRODUCTION 
ADC Solutions Auto LLC (“Petitioner”) filed a corrected Petition 
(Paper 6, “Pet.”)1 requesting an inter partes review of claims 1, 32, 38, 39, 
47, 52, and 54 (Pet. 8) of U.S. Patent No. 11,447,023 B2 (Ex. 1001, 
“the ’023 patent”).  The NOCO Company (“Patent Owner”) filed a 
Preliminary Response to the Petition.  Paper 7 (“Prelim. Resp.”). 
Upon consideration of the Petition, Preliminary Response, and the 
parties’ evidence, we determined that Petitioner had demonstrated a 
reasonable likelihood that it would prevail with respect to at least one claim 
of the ’023 patent.  Paper 8 (“Decision on Institution” or “DI”).  Thus, 
pursuant to the Supreme Court’s decision in SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 
U.S. 357, 364 (2018), and the USPTO Guidance,2 we instituted review of all 
challenged claims on all challenged grounds.  Id. 
Following institution of trial, Patent Owner filed a Patent Owner 
Response (Paper 12, “PO Resp.”), Petitioner filed a Reply (Paper 15, “Pet. 
Reply”), and Patent Owner filed a Sur-reply (Paper 18, “Sur-reply”).  
In support of their respective positions, Petitioner relies on the testimony of 
 
1 Petitioner filed a “[c]orrected” Petition (Paper 6) to address a duplication 
of exhibits (namely, Exs. 1024–1025).  The duplication was resolved by 
addressing the exhibits and does not cause any inconsistency between the 
original petition (i.e., Paper 1) and present record (e.g., does not cause 
incorrect citations).  This Decision thus addresses the Corrected Petition 
(i.e., Paper 6).   
2 In accordance with our rules, “[w]hen instituting inter partes review, the 
Board will authorize the review to proceed on all of the challenged claims 
and on all grounds of unpatentability asserted for each claim.”  37 C.F.R. 
§ 42.108(a).

Dr. C. Arthur MacCarley (Ex. 1003 and 1044) and Patent Owner relies on 
the testimony of Dr. Ayma Fayed (Ex. 2011). 
We held an oral hearing on May 29, 2025, and a transcript of the 
hearing is included in the record (Paper 24, “Tr.”). 
We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6.  This Final Written 
Decision is issued pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73.   
For the reasons discussed below, we determine that Petitioner has 
shown by a preponderance of the evidence that 1, 32, 38, 39, 47, 52, and 54 
of the ’023 patent are unpatentable. 
A. Real Parties-in-Interest 
Petitioner identifies “ADC Solutions Auto LLC” as the sole real 
party-in-interest.  Pet. 1. 
Patent Owner identifies “The Noco Company” as the real 
party -in -interest.  Paper 3 (Mandatory Notice), 2. 
B. Related Proceedings

Petitioner also states that the ’023 patent “stems from a line of 
continuation applications claiming priority back to . . . U.S. Patent 
No. 9,007,015 (EX1013)” and that  “[a]ll claims of the ’015 patent were 
challenged in inter partes review, IPR2020-00944, which resulted in a Final 
Written Decision (‘the ’015-FWD’) finding all claims, except claim 11, 
unpatentable.”  Pet. 12 (citing Ex. 1001, code (60); Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 28–29; Ex. 
1014).  The ’015-FWD was affirmed by the Federal Circuit under Federal 
Circuit Rule 36.  Id. (citing Ex. 1015).   
Patent Owner likewise identifies each and only the above actions as 
related proceedings.  Paper 3 (Mandatory Notice).   
C. The ’023 patent (Ex. 1001) 
The ’023 patent, titled “Portable Vehicle Battery Jump Start 
Apparatus with Safety Protection and Jumper Cable Device Thereof,” issued 
on September 20, 2022.  Ex. 1001, codes (45), (54).  The “invention relates 
generally to apparatus for jump-starting a vehicle having a depleted or 
discharged battery.”  Id. at 1:8–10. 
The ’023 patent discloses a “handheld battery booster according to 
one aspect of the invention.”  Id. at 4:1–5.  “At the heart of the handheld 
battery booster is a lithium polymer battery pack 32, which stores sufficient 
energy to jump start a vehicle engine served by a conventional 12 volt

handheld jump starter shown in Figure 3.  Id. at 7:53–54.   
 
Figure 4 “is a plan view of a jumper cable.”  Id. at 3:65–67.  Figure 4 
illustrates the following:  plug 401 configured to plug into 12 volt output 
port 303 of handheld device 300; a pair of cables 402a, 402b integrated with 
plug 401 (having body 401a, surface protrusion 401b, and flat end 401c) and 
respectively connected to positive and negative polarity battery terminal 
clamps 403a, 403b via ring terminals 404a, 404b.  Id. at 7:55–60.  Handheld 
booster device 300 is connected to a vehicle battery by connecting the plug 
401 into the output port 303 and connecting the battery clamps 403a, 403b to 
respective terminals of the battery.  Id. at 8:2–11.

E. The Asserted Unpatentability Challenges 
Petitioner asserts that claims 1, 32, 38, 39, 47, 52, and 54 would have 
been unpatentable based on the following grounds:  
Claim(s) Challenged 35 U.S.C. §4 Reference(s)/Basis 
1, 32, 38, 39, 47, 52, 54 103 Richardson,5 Zhao6 
1, 32, 38, 39, 47, 52, 54 103 Yu,7 Paparrizos8 
Pet. 8.  Petitioner also relies on declaration testimony of C. Arthur 
MacCarley to support its contentions.  Ex. 1003 (the “MacCarley 
Declaration”).

II. ANALYSIS 
A. Principles of Law 
In an inter partes review, “the petitioner has the burden from the onset 
to show with particularity why the patent it challenges is unpatentable.”  
Harmonic Inc. v. Avid Tech., Inc., 815 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2016) 
(citing 35 U.S.C. § 312(a)(3) (2012) (requiring inter partes review petitions 
to identify “with particularity . . . the evidence that supports the grounds for 
the challenge to each claim”)).  This burden of persuasion never shifts to the 
patent owner.  See Dynamic Drinkware, LLC v. Nat’l Graphics, Inc., 800 
F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (discussing the burden of proof in inter 
partes review).   
Obviousness is a question of law based on underlying determinations 
of fact.  Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17 (1966); Richardson-
Vicks, Inc. v. Upjohn Co., 122 F.3d 1476, 1479 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  A claim is 
unpatentable as obvious, under 35 U.S.C. § 103, if the differences between 
the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention, 
as a whole, would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the 
claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art.  KSR Int’l 
Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 406 (2007).  The question of obviousness 
is resolved on the basis of underlying factual determinations including (1) 
the scope and content of the prior art; (2) any differences between the 
claimed subject matter and the prior art; (3) the level of ordinary skill in the 
art; and (4) objective evidence of nonobviousness.9  Graham, 383 U.S. at 
 
9 Patent Owner does not provide objective evidence of nonobviousness.  See 
generally PO Resp.   

IPR2024-00577 
Patent 11,447,023 B2  
11 
17–18.  Consideration of the Graham factors “helps inform the ultimate 
obviousness determination.”  Apple Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 839 F.3d 
1034, 1048 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (en banc), cert. denied, 583 U.S. 963 (2017).  
“Obviousness does not require absolute predictability of success[;] . . . all 
that is required is a reasonable expectation of success.”  In re O’Farrell, 853 
F.2d 894, 903–04 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (citations omitted).  But, a petitioner 
cannot satisfy its burden of proving obviousness by employing “mere 
conclusory statements.”  In re Magnum Oil Tools Int’l, Ltd., 829 F.3d 1364, 
1380 (Fed. Cir. 2016).   
We analyze the challenges presented in the Petition in accordance 
with the above-stated principles. 
B. Level of Ordinary Skill in the Art 
We review the grounds of unpatentability in view of the 
understanding of a person having ordinary skill in the art (“PHOSITA”) 
before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.  Graham, 383 
U.S. at 17.   
Petitioner contends that a person of ordinary skill in the art,  
as of the claimed priority date of July 3, 2014, would have been 
a person with at least a bachelor’s degree in electrical 
engineering or its equivalent and at least two years of experience 
in the field of electrical engineering including some experience 
with DC power supply or battery charger design[;] . . . [l]ess 
work experience could be compensated for by a higher level of 
education, such as a master’s degree, and vice versa. 
 
Pet. 22 (citing Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 39–42; Ex. 1014, 10–11).  Patent Owner “does 
not propose a different level of skill in the art.”  PO Resp. 19. 

IPR2024-00577 
Patent 11,447,023 B2  
12 
In light of the record before us, and for purposes of this Decision, we 
adopt Petitioner’s proposal regarding the level of ordinary skill in the art.  
Based on our review of the ’023 patent and the prior art of record, we 
determine that the definition offered by Petitioner comports with the 
qualifications a person would have needed to understand the ’023 patent and 
the prior art.   
C. Claim Construction 
We construe claim terms according to the standard set forth in Phillips 
v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312–17 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc).  
37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b).  Under Phillips, we give claim terms “their ordinary 
and customary meaning.”  Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312.  “[T]he ordinary and 
customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have 
to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the 
invention.”  Id. at 1313.  “Importantly, the person of ordinary skill in the art 
is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular 
claim in which the disputed term appears, but in the context of the entire 
patent, including the specification.”  Id. 
“Petitioner submits there are no formal claim constructions necessary 
in this proceeding.”  Pet. 23.  Patent Owner “does not propose any terms 
need to be construed.”  PO Resp. 18.   
As neither party proposes an express construction for our 
consideration and because we determine that claim construction is not 
necessary to decide whether to institute, we do not expressly construe any 
claim terms.  See Vivid Techs., Inc. v. Am. Sci. & Eng’g, Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 
803 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (holding that “only those terms need be construed that 
are in controversy, and only to the extent necessary to resolve the 

IPR2024-00577 
Patent 11,447,023 B2  
13 
controversy”); see also Nidec Motor Corp. v. Zhongshan Broad Ocean 
Motor Co., 868 F.3d 1013, 1017 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (citing Vivid Techs. in the 
context of an inter partes review). 
D. Challenge Based on Richardson and Zhao (Ground 1) 
Petitioner alleges that claims 1, 32, 38, 39, 47, 52, and 54 of the ’023 
patent are rendered obvious by Richardson and Zhao.  Pet. 30.  
1. Overview of the Prior Art 
a) Richardson (Ex. 1005) 
Richardson is titled “method and apparatus for providing 
supplemental power to an engine.”  Ex. 1005, code (54).  Richardson 
“relates to a portable power source for a motor vehicle and, more 
particularly, to a method and apparatus to provide supplemental power to 
start internal combustion and turbine engines.”  Id. ¶ 2.  Richardson explains 
that if “the batteries [of a motor vehicle] are cross-connected or the clamps 
inadvertently contact each other when one end of the jumper cables is 
connected to a battery, sparking can occur resulting in . . . a potential for the 
batteries exploding and fire.”  Id. ¶ 5.   
Richardson states that  
The present invention monitors the voltage of the battery 
of the vehicle to be jump started and the current delivered by the 
jump starter .  . . to determine if a proper connection has been 
established and to provide fault monitoring.  For safety purposes, 
only if the proper polarity is detected can the system operate. . . .  
The system includes one or more internal batteries and capacitors 
to provide the power to the battery of the vehicle to be jump 
started.  Once the vehicle is started, the vehicle’s elec trical 
system may recharge the batteries and capacitors before the unit 
automatically electrically disconnects from the vehicle’s battery. 
Id. ¶ 7.   

IPR2024-00577 
Patent 11,447,023 B2  
14 
An example jump starter 10 (illustrated by a schematic of Figure 1 
and by circuit diagrams of Figures 2A–D) includes microprocessor 12, 
sensors, LED indicators, capacitors 21 and batteries 22 that collectively 
supply charging power for charging a vehicle battery, two in-series shunt 
cables 36, 37 that carry the charging power to the vehicle battery, and 
contact relay 34 that selectively gates the charging power to the vehicle 
battery (relaying between the shunt cables 36, 37).  Id. ¶¶ 12, 14, 16, Fig. 1.  
When jump starter 10 is powered on, microprocessor 12 initializes the 
hardware, reads all system parameters and variables, and initializes an 
interrupt service routine.  Id. ¶ 22.  As part of the routine, a voltage is 
measured to determine whether cables 36, 37 have been reverse connected to 
the vehicle.  Id. ¶ 27.  If so, then microprocessor 12 prevents jump starting 
until the reverse polarity condition is corrected.  Id.  Similarly, another 
voltage is measured to determine whether jump starter batteries 22 are not 
sufficiently charged.  Id. ¶ 28.  Microprocessor 12 prevents jump starting 
until jump starter batteries 22 are sufficiently charged.  Id. ¶¶ 28–29.   
When the jump starter has been successfully initiated, contact relay 34 
is closed and jump starter capacitors 21 and batteries 22 connect to the 
vehicle battery.  Id. ¶ 21.  Contact relay 34 is opened if the start cycle has 
successfully completed, a start fault occurs, or the operator interrupts the 
start cycle.  Id.   
Jump starter 10 may be selectively configured for 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 
42, or 48 volts.  Id. ¶ 34.  For example, if batteries 23 are both 12-volt 
batteries, the system may be configured for 12-volt or 24-volt operation.  Id.   

IPR2024-00577 
Patent 11,447,023 B2  
15 
b) Zhao (Ex. 1006) 
Zhao is titled “step-up battery charging management system and 
control method thereof.”  Ex. 1006, code (54).  Zhao states that 
Battery charging systems typically utilize .  . . an input 
supplied by a power supply adapter[] and an output coupled to a 
single-cell battery[] or multi-cell batteries.  A universal serial bus 
(USB) power supply system usually has a rating power supply 
voltage of 5V.  A single -cell lithium battery can employ 
. . . step-down topology to charge the single-cell battery.  Step-up 
topology can be used in battery management systems with series 
connected multi -cell lithium batteries.  However, in some 
circumstances, such as high input cur rent or short-circuit at the 
output, if relatively large current is used directly for charging, the 
electronic device and/or its battery can be damaged. 
Id. at 1:19–30.  Figure 1, reproduced below, is an exemplary charger. 
 
Figure 1 “is a schematic block diagram of a first example step-up battery 
charger in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.”  Id. at 
1:59–61.  Step-up battery charger 100 principally includes step-up converter 
control circuit 102, charging control circuit 201, and power stage circuit 101.  
Id. at 2:63–3:39.  Step-up converter portion 101, 102 of charger 100 receives 


IPR2024-00577 
Patent 11,447,023 B2  
16 
and boosts a DC input voltage Vin to generate and output a boosted output 
signal to charging control circuit 201 for charging of in-series lithium 
batteries.  Id. at 3:1–7.  DC input voltage Vin is provided by a “universal 
serial bus (USB) charger[] or any other suitable low voltage power supply 
system.”  Id. at 3:8–11.   
2. Analysis of Claim 1 
Petitioner argues that the combination of Richardson and Zhao 
renders claim 1 obvious.  Pet. 30.  Petitioner alleges that Richardson 
discloses a jump starting apparatus with a power supply, i.e., Richardson’s 
batteries 22.  Id. at 32–34 (citing Ex. 1005, Abstr., ¶¶ 2, 4, 6–7, 14, 16, 21, 
35, Figs. 1, 2A, 2C, 3–8; Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 68, 70).  Petitioner contends that 
Richardson’s positive (red clamp) terminal connector and negative (black 
clamp) terminal connector (together jumper cables 60) teach a positive 
polarity and negative polarity battery terminal configured for connecting the 
jump starting apparatus to the positive/negative polarity battery terminal, as 
claimed.  Id. at 34–37 (Ex. 1005, Abstr., claim 26, ¶¶ 16, 27–28, Fig. 2C; 
Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 72–73).  Petitioner contends that limitation 1(d) is taught by 
Richardson’s contact relay 34.  Id. at 37–39 (citing Ex. 1005 ¶¶ 21, 35–36, 
54, claim 26, Figs. 1, 6 (step 268); Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 76–77).  Petitioner further 
asserts that the control system or circuit of limitation 1(e) is taught by 
Richardson’s microcontroller 12 and reverse voltage sensor 24.  Id. at 39–42 
(citing Ex. 1005, Abstr., ¶¶ 14, 16, 18, 20, 27, 36, claim 26, Figs. 1, 2A–C; 
Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 79–81).  Petitioner also notes that “Patent Owner admitted 
‘Richardson discloses detecting proper polarity’ during prosecution.”  Id. 
at 42 (Ex. 1002, 496; Ex. 1003 ¶ 82).

With respect to limitation 1(f), Petitioner argues that although 
“Richardson teaches its system includes various features related to charging 
the jump starter batteries, such as circuitry for detecting a charger voltage 
and monitoring battery voltage to determine when the charging process is 
complete,” “Richardson does not teach the jump starter’s charging circuitry 
utilizes USB technology.”  Pet. 42–43 (citing Ex. 1005 ¶¶ 20, 28–29; 
Ex. 1003 ¶ 84).  But, Petitioner contends that 
Zhao teaches USB input circuits configured for converting 
power from a USB power source (such as one providing a 5V 
input) to increase power voltage to the power supply were well-
known for portable battery -powered devices that require 
charging a multicell battery pack with a voltage rating above the 
voltage received from the power source. 
Id. at 43 (citing Ex. 1006, Abstr., 1:22–23, 1:25–27, 3:6–11; Ex. 1003 ¶ 85).  
Petitioner further alleges that Zhao teaches a technique to boost an input 
voltage, such as a 5V USB power source, to a higher output voltage.  Id. 
at 43–44 (citing Ex. 1006, Abstr., 1:22–23, 1:25–27, 1:34–45, 1:46–66, 
2:51–62, 2:63–3:11; Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 85–86).   
Petitioner alleges that a person of ordinary skill in the art  
would have been motivated to modify the design of Richardson’s 
jump starter to either (1) replace the existing charging circuitry 
with Zhao’s step-up charging system and connect the output to 
Richardson’s jump starter batteries, or (2) add Zhao’s step -up 
charging system and connect the output to Richardson’s jump 
starter batteries as an additional and alternatively pathway for 
charging the jump starter batteries.  EX1003, ¶ 88.   
Id. at 45.  According to Petitioner, either option identified would have been 
beneficial: 
For example, although option 1 may result in longer charging 
times, it allows the supplier to avoid the need to supply a 

IPR2024-00577 
Patent 11,447,023 B2  
18 
proprietary charger or other type of AC “power brick” that would 
be less ubiquitous or less standardized than a USB charger .  
Id.  On the other hand, while option 2 would result in a slight 
increase in cost for including an additional input connector and 
DC-DC conversion circuitry in Richardson’s jump starter, the 
desirable benefits would include increased flexibility so that the 
jump starter batteries could be charged via a traditional AC 
power brick when available, but alternatively by a USB charger 
if the AC power brick is lost, damaged, or the user is otherwise 
in a location where only USB power is readily available.   
Id. at 45. 
Petitioner further alleges that “the desirability of utilizing USB 
technology to charge battery-powered devices was well-known before the 
priority date.”  Pet. 46–49 (citing Ex. 1001, 7:21–25; Ex. 1025, 6; Ex. 1024 
¶¶ 1–4, 8; Ex. 1016 ¶¶ 2, 11; Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 89–91; Ex. 1029; Ex. 1030;

42:23–43:22; 44:2–19; 51:14–54:13, 54:25–56:14; Ex. 1026, 53:2–18;

Fig. 1).  Petitioner identifies the “desired benefits of USB technology” as 
including, inter alia, “(1) reducing the need for suppliers to ship product with 
proprietary chargers (thus reducing cost of goods and avoiding electronic 
waste), (2) providing device users with the desired result of reducing their 
need to possess or carry multiple proprietary chargers and cables for their 
battery-powered devices (e.g. the goal of universal compatibility), (3) ease 
of use, and (4) durability.”  Id. at 46 (citing Ex. 1016 ¶ 2; Ex. 1003 ¶ 89). 
As to use of a USB input connector, i.e., limitation (g), Petitioner 
asserts that although “Richardson is not explicit regarding the type of input 
connector utilized for charging the jump start batteries,” “a [person of 

IPR2024-00577 
Patent 11,447,023 B2  
19 
ordinary skill in the art] would have been familiar with the relevant USB 
standards and been motivated to implement USB technology when designing 
a portable battery-powered device,” e.g., “implementation of 
commercially-available USB receptacles (such as a micro-USB receptacle) 
when designing a USB charging feature.”  Pet. 50.  According to Petitioner, 
a person of ordinary skill in the art 
would have known Zhao’s system implements a design requiring 
the remaining portions of a USB charging system, especially a 
USB-compliant receptacle (such as a micro-USB connector).  A 
[person of ordinary skill in the art’s]  knowledge of these USB 
input connectors—which the ’023 patent admits are “standard” 
(see EX1001, 7:23 –25)—is further corroborated by the USB 
standards and other prior art discussing these standard 
connectors.  See, e.g., EX1009, 1:20 –23 (discussing USB, 
mini-USB, and micro -USB connectors ); EX1018; EX1019, 
¶ [0004] (discussing “Mini-USB interface”). 
Id. at 50–51 (also citing Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 94–95).  
Patent Owner does not challenge many of Petitioner’s allegations 
regarding the teachings of Richardson10 and Zhao.  See generally PO Resp.  
We have reviewed Petitioner’s arguments and evidence and agree—based on 
the information provided in the Petition—that the preponderance of the 
evidence supports Petitioner’s contention that the combination of 
Richardson and Zhao teaches each limitation of claim 1 of the ’023 patent.  
Patent Owner does assert, however, that the skilled artisan would not have 
had reason to combine the teachings of Richardson and Zhao as Petitioner 
suggests.  Id. at 25–38.  Specifically, Patent Owner contents that Petitioner 
 
10 Petitioner notes “[t]he Board made similar factual findings regarding 
Richardson in the ’015-FWD, which was affirmed on appeal.”  Pet. 32–42 
(citing Ex. 1014 at 50–67; Ex. 1015 at 2; Ex. 1003 ¶¶ 69–83).   

IPR2024-00577 
Patent 11,447,023 B2  
20 
has failed to show a reason to combine because (1) Richardson’s device 
would not function properly with Zhao’s USB charging port (id. at 25–31); 
(2) no explanation is provided about how to incorporate Zhao’s USB 
charging port into Richardson’s system (id. at 32–34); and (3) no evidence 
suggests that Zhao’s step-up converter could charge Richardson’s device (id. 
at 37–38).  We address Patent Owner’s argument below. 
a) Whether Petitioner Has Shown a Reason to 
Include a USB Charging Port in Richardson  
Patent Owner argues that the reasons to combine the teachings of 
Richardson and Zhao, provided by Petitioner, are insufficient to support the 
combination.  PO Resp. 25–31.  Specifically, Patent Owner contends that 
Richardson’s jump starter is used to charge a fleet of vehicles, having high 
capacity batteries, over a short period of time and a person of ordinary skill 
in the art would not have had reason to use Zhao’s USB system to charge a 
high-voltage, large capacity battery system because Zhao does not teach 
using its USB system at voltages above 8.4V or to charge large capacity 
batteries.  Id.  According to Patent Owner, “charging such a large-capacity 
battery with USB was counterintuitive, not because boost converting an 
input voltage was not understood in the art, but instead because it was well 
understood that the limited charging current that traditional USB provided 
was not capable of quickly charging high-capacity battery systems.”  Id. at 
27.  Patent Owner alleges that charging a 48V battery pack, like that 
contemplated by Richardson, “would require four times the number of 
series-connected battery cells of a typical 12V vehicle charger, assuming 
peak current is maintained” and that “[c]harging Richardson’s system would 
therefore take four times longer than a jump starter designed to jump start
