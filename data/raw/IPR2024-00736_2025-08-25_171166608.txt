I. INTRODUCTION 
We instituted inter partes review pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 314 to review 
claims 1, 4–7, 9, and 11 of U.S. Patent 7,574,725 B2 (“the ’725 patent”) owned 
by Digital Media Technology Holdings, LLC (“Patent Owner”). We have 
jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(c). This Final Written Decision is entered 
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73. For the reasons discussed 
below, Disney Media & Entertainment Distribution LLC (“Petitioner”) has 
shown by a preponderance of the evidence that all the challenged claims of the 
’725 patent are unpatentable.  
II. BACKGROUND 
Petitioner filed a petition requesting inter partes review of claims 1, 4–7, 9, 
and 11 of the ’725 patent. Paper 2 (“Pet.”). Patent Owner filed a Preliminary 
Response. Paper 8 (“Prelim. Resp.”). Petitioner filed a Preliminary Reply, Paper 
11, and Patent Owner filed a Corrected Preliminary Sur-Reply, Paper 14. 
After considering the merits of the Petition and the arguments presented 
against institution by Patent Owner, we instituted inter partes review of all the 
challenged claims of the ’725 patent on all grounds asserted in the Petition. See 
37 C.F.R. § 42.108(a); Paper 15 (Decision Granting Institution (“Dec.”)). 
During the trial phase, Patent Owner filed a Response to the Petition. Paper 
18 (“PO Resp.”). Petitioner filed a Reply, Paper 27 (“Reply Br.”), and Patent 
Owner filed a Sur-Reply, Paper 28 (“Sur-Reply Br.”). Oral argument was held on 
July 9, 2025, the transcript of which is filed in the record. Paper 39 (“Tr.”).

Amended Compl. (D. Del.)).  
B. The Patent-at-Issue 
1. Prosecution History 
U.S. Application No. 09/840,283, filed on April 23, 2001, now U.S. Patent 
No. 7,574,725 B2, claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/201,118 
filed on May 2, 2000. See Ex. 1001 codes (21), (22), (60) (’725 patent); Ex. 1004 
(’725 file history). During prosecution, the Examiner rejected claims of the ’725 
patent in three Non-Final and three Final Office Actions, resulting in six rounds 
of claim amendments. See generally Ex. 1004. As issued on August 11, 2009, the 
’725 patent contains twenty-three claims, of which claims 1, 13–15, and 22 are 
independent. Ex. 1001 at 16:19–20:30. 
2. Overview 
The ’725 patent discloses a method of marketing and distributing 
multimedia. Ex. 1001, 1:20–21. A central server storing multimedia material in 
digital format, such as motion pictures and television programming, is connected 
to a communications network, such as the Internet. Id. at 2:53–57, 3:13–17. In 
addition to the base media, advertising materials can be downloaded from the 
server system. Id. at 3:20–21. Exhibitors, such as theaters and television stations, 
can access the central server, preview available programming and download the 
programming along with marketing materials for the program or movie. Id. 
at 2:60–65, 3:12–21. The exhibitors show the multimedia material in a public 
theater to individuals in exchange for a paid admission, or are broadcast 
exhibitors. Id. at 2:64–65. Finally, “[i]n addition to providing multimedia to 
users, the server system collects data about the users and information respecting 
the economics and sales success of exhibitors and broadcasters.” Id. at 3:22–25.  

IPR2024-00736

Figure 1 of the ’725 patent is illustrative and is reproduced below. 
 
Ex. 1001, Fig. 1. As shown above, Figure 1 is “a block diagram generally 
illustrating the inventive system for marketing and distributing multimedia 
products.” Id. at 3:39–41. In the illustrated embodiment, “the system exchanges 
information through the use of cyberspace 12, which may be either a private 
computer-based communications system or a public system, such as that known 
under the alleged trademark the Internet.” Id. at 4:5–9. Multimedia producer 14 is 
linked to central server 16 which functions as a distribution web site. Id. at 4:10–
12. “Multimedia producer 14 may also be connected to central server 16 via a 
private network link 20, thus providing either a faster data link, a more secure 
link, or both.” Id. at 4:13–16. “Similarly, a plurality of exhibitors, including a 
movie theater 18a, a television station 18b, a satellite television operator 18c, a 
cable television operator 18d[,] and a high school 18e, are also connected through 
cyberspace 12 to central server 16.” Id. at 4:20–23.

C. Illustrative Claim 
Of the challenged claims of the ’725 patent, only claim 1 is independent. 
Each of the remaining claims depends directly from claim 1. We reproduce claim 
1 below, which is illustrative: 
1. A method of marketing and distributing multimedia, the 
method comprising: 
a. receiving, by a server, multimedia material and advertising 
material from a producer or owner of said multimedia material, said 
advertising material being associated with said multimedia material, 
said advertising material comprising audio and video components; 
b. storing said multimedia material and associated advertising 
material on a computer readable storage medium as correlated 
information in digital format; 
c. providing a server system accessible over a communication 
network, said server system accessing said correlated information in 
a digital format from said computer readable storage medium for 
transfer of said correlated information in a digital format ove r said 
communication network to potential purchasers; 
d. providing samples of said correlated information in a digital 
format from said server system over said communication network to 
said potential purchasers, said purchasers being linked to the server 
system through said communication network; 
e. downloading to said purchasers, upon request of said 
purchasers, over said communication network, said correlated 
information in a digital format corresponding to said multimedia 
material from said server system, said purchasers storing downloaded 
correlated information in a digital format corresponding to said 
multimedia material; and 
f. providing said correlated information in a digital format 
corresponding to said advertising material that is associated with said 
multimedia material to said purchasers from said server system over 
said communication network, allowing purchasers to locally  market 
and sell said multimedia material, said purchasers downloading said 
correlated information in a digital format corresponding to said 
advertising material that is associated with said multimedia material, 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
6 
said purchasers storing the downloaded correlated information in a 
digital format corresponding to said advertising material; and 
g. wherein said purchaser is an exhibitor exhibiting said 
multimedia material, after deriving said multimedia material from 
said stored correlated information in a digital format corresponding to 
said multimedia material, in a public theater to a number of  
individuals in exchange for a paid admission or a broadcast exhibitor, 
said advertising material, after deriving of said advertising material 
from said correlated information in a digital format corresponding to 
said stored associated advertising material, being shown to the public 
at a time or in a place different from the time or place at which said 
associated multimedia material is displayed.

No. 112-29, 125 Stat. 284 (2011), took effect on March 16, 2013. Because the 
application for the ’725 patent was filed before the effective date of the relevant 
amendment, the pre-AIA version of Section 103 applies.

Pet. 3. 
Petitioner also relies on a Declaration of Dr. Henry H. Houh, who is 
proffered as an expert in the field of “web based systems, streaming multimedia 
systems, distributed systems, and network architectures.” Ex. 1002 ¶ 24. 
Dr. Houh also provided a Supplemental Declaration. Ex. 1022. In addition, 
Petitioner relies on a Declaration of June Munford regarding the authenticity and 
public availability of certain documents. Ex. 1014. 
Patent Owner relies on a Declaration of Mr. Nick Stiliadis, the named 
inventor on the ’725 patent. Ex. 2109. Patent Owner further relies on the 
declarations of Mr. John Daniels, an entrepreneur with a background in 
engineering physics (Ex. 2121), and Mr. Harris E. Tulchin, an entertainment 
attorney (Ex. 2131). There is a pending motion to exclude the declarations of 
Mr. Daniels and Mr. Tulchin on the basis that neither witness qualifies as a 
person of ordinary skill in the art. Paper 33 (“Pet.’s Mot. to Exclude”). We 
discuss this motion in Section II.E.2 below. 
E. Level of Ordinary Skill in the Art 
To determine whether an invention would have been obvious at the time it 
was made, we consider the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art at the time 
of the invention. Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U.S. 1, 17 
(1966). Various factors may be considered, including the “type of problems 
encountered in the art; prior art solutions to those problems; rapidity with which 
innovations are made; sophistication of the technology; and educational level of 
active workers in the field.” In re GPAC, Inc., 57 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 
1995) (citing Custom Accessories, Inc. v. Jeffrey-Allan Indus., Inc., 807 F.2d 955, 
962–63 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). “[O]ne or more factors may predominate.” Id. 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
8 
1. Determination of the Level of Ordinary Skill in the Art 
Petitioner argues that one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the 
invention was made “would have had a bachelor’s degree in electrical 
engineering, computer engineering, computer science, or a related field, and at 
least one year of experience in the field of multimedia processing or 
communication networks, or the equivalent, with additional education 
substituting for experience and vice versa.” Pet. 5–6. 
In its Preliminary Response submitted prior to institution of trial, Patent 
Owner contended that a person of ordinary skill in the art did not require a 
technical degree. See Dec. 8–9. In its Response, Patent Owner revised its 
position. PO Resp. 11. Patent Owner now proposes the following level of skill for 
a person of ordinary skill in the art: “Bachelor of Science in electrical 
engineering, engineering physics, computer engineering, computer science, or a 
related field plus one year of experience related to marketing and distribution of 
multimedia material over a computer network, or the equivalent.” Id. Patent 
Owner contends that its current proposal is “substantially the same as” the 
definition adopted by the Board in the Decision on Institution. Id.  
In our Decision on Institution, we adopted the following definition of the 
level of skill for one of ordinary skill in the art: “a Bachelor of Science degree in 
electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, or a related field 
plus one year of experience related to marketing and distribution of multimedia 
material over a computer network, or the equivalent.” Dec. 9. Patent Owner’s 
proposed definition differs from the Board’s only in that it adds a Bachelor of 
Science in engineering physics to the list of degrees that one of ordinary skill in 
the art might possess. See id. We view engineering physics as being related to the 
fields of electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science. 
Accordingly, following a review of the full record, we view Patent Owner’s 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
9 
proposed definition in its Response as consistent with the ’725 patent and the 
asserted prior art, and we apply it in our analysis below. 
2. Petitioner’s Motion to Exclude 
Petitioner has filed a motion to exclude from evidence the declarations of 
Mr. Daniels (Ex. 2121) and Mr. Tulchin (Ex. 2131) on the basis that neither 
witness possesses the requisite level of skill in the relevant art, as identified 
above.2 Petitioner argues that: (1) Mr. Daniels and Mr. Tulchin are not persons of 
ordinary skill in the art (“POSITAs”); (2) non-POSITA expert declarations are 
inadmissible because they fail to meet the requirements of Fed. R. Evid. 702; and 
(3) even if the declarations were relevant, the risk of confusion would outweigh 
any alleged probative value that they might have, and therefore the declarations 
should be excluded under Fed. R. Evid. 403. Paper 33, 1 (“Mot. to Exclude”). 
Patent Owner opposes the Motion to Exclude, with Petitioner filing a Reply to 
the opposition. Papers 34, 37.  
Our reviewing court has held that if a declarant fails to qualify as a person 
of ordinary skill in the art, then that person’s testimony regarding the knowledge 
or motivations of one of ordinary skill in the art is irrelevant as a matter of law. 
Kyocera Senco Indus. Tools Inc. v. International Trade Comm’n, 22 F.4th 1369, 
1377–78 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (“To offer expert testimony from the perspective of a 
skilled artisan in a patent case—like for claim construction, validity, or 
infringement—a witness must at least have ordinary skill in the art.  Without that 
skill, the witness’ opinions are neither relevant nor reliable.”). Mr. Daniels’ 
declaration consists of an analysis of the cited prior art in comparison to the 
challenged claims and a discussion of whether there would have been a 
 
2 The motion does not seek to exclude the declaration of the named inventor of 
the ’725 patent, Nick Stiliadis. See Ex. 2109 (Stiliadis Declaration). 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
10 
motivation to combine the prior art. Ex. 2121 ¶¶ 4–20. Mr. Tulchin’s declaration 
addresses claim construction issues. Ex. 2131 ¶¶ 5–35. Each declarant, therefore, 
addresses issues that must be considered from the vantage point of a POSITA at 
the time of the invention, meaning a person with the level of ordinary skill 
defined in Section II.E.1 above. See Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303 (Fed. 
Cir. 2005) (en banc) (claim construction); KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 
398, 406 (2007) (obviousness). If Mr. Daniels and Mr. Tulchin do not qualify as 
POSITAs, as Petitioner alleges, then their opinion testimony is inadmissible 
under Federal Rules of Evidence 702 (Testimony by Expert Witnesses). 
We find that there is insufficient evidence in the record to establish that 
Mr. Daniels qualifies as a POSITA in relation to the ’725 patent. Mr. Daniels has 
an undergraduate degree in engineering physics in addition to a law degree. 
Ex. 2121 ¶ 2. His declaration, however, does not establish that he also has “one 
year of experience related to marketing and distribution of multimedia material 
over a computer network, or the equivalent.” See Section II.E.1 above. 
Mr. Daniels characterizes his non-legal work experience as follows: 
The rest of my professional career has been spent working in 
my own companies in the research, development and 
prototyping/commercialization of a number of different technologies, 
principally including fishing rod technology, digital video file 
transport, storage and processing, LED -based light -emitting tapes, 
drone control systems, wearable medical related electronic devices 
and breath-based diagnostic devices.  
Ex. 2121 ¶ 3; see also Ex. 1023, 99 (Daniels Deposition) (describing work on “a 
suite of interactive television innovations,” including “the first working pause 
button”). None of the projects identified appears to relate to “marketing and 
distribution of multimedia material over a computer network.”  
Patent Owner argues that Mr. Daniels “was involved (at the time of the 
filing of the application which matured into the ’725 patent) in making 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
11 
inventions, that dealt with interactive television, video pause buttons and video 
file provision over the Internet.” Sur-Reply Br. 6. However, neither Mr. Daniels’ 
declaration nor his deposition testimony assert that he ever worked on “video file 
provision over the Internet,” let alone that he did so for one year or more. See 
Ex. 2121 ¶ 3; Ex. 1023, 98–100. We find that the evidence in the record is not 
sufficient for us to conclude that Mr. Daniels qualifies as one of ordinary skill in 
the art.  
We further find a lack of evidence establishing that Mr. Tulchin qualifies 
as a POSITA in relation to the ’725 patent. Mr. Tulchin is an entertainment 
lawyer. Ex. 1028, 8:23–24. He is also involved in “motion picture production 
finance and distribution.” Id. at 8:24–25; see also Ex. 2131 ¶ 4. He has earned a 
Bachelor of Science in industrial labor relations as well as a law degree, but he 
does not have a technical degree. Ex. 1028, 10:2–17. In his declaration, he 
acknowledges that he has “no specialized computer science training.” Ex. 2131 
¶ 10. Mr. Tulchin therefore has neither the educational background of a POSITA, 
as defined above, nor, as far as the record evidence indicates, the requisite one 
year of experience in “marketing and distribution of multimedia material over a 
computer network.” See Section II.E.1 above. While there is evidence that 
Mr. Tulchin is highly knowledgeable about the movie industry in general, there is 
insufficient evidence to conclude that he meets our determined definition of a 
POSITA. Accordingly, we grant Petitioner’s Motion to exclude the declarations 
of Mr. Daniels and Mr. Tulchin from evidence. 
III. CLAIM CONSTRUCTION 
In an inter partes review proceeding based on a petition filed on or after 
November 13, 2018, such as this, we construe claims using the same claim 
construction standard that would be used in a civil action under 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
12 
35 U.S.C. § 282(b), as articulated in Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1303, and its progeny. 
See 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b). 
Patent Owner’s claim construction arguments in its Response to the 
Petition, in toto, read as follows: 
A. “Exhibition” – a public showing. 
B. “Exhibitor” – one in the exhibition business. 
C. “Broadcast Exhibitor” – one in the business of over-the-air 
broadcasting 
D. “Distribution” – the business of marketing films and providing 
copies to venues 
E. “Marketing” – actions taken to interest individuals in seeing a film. 
F. “Storing” – electronically saving on a non-volatile storage element. 
PO Resp. 10. The Response contains no citations to intrinsic evidence that might 
support Patent Owner’s constructions. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314 (the proper 
definition is the “definition that one of ordinary skill in the art could ascertain 
from the intrinsic evidence in the record”) (quoting Unitherm Food Sys., Inc. v. 
Swift–Eckrich, Inc., 375 F.3d 1341, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). Nor do Patent 
Owner’s briefs cite to any extrinsic evidence.3 Patent Owner’s Sur-Reply 
contains a section with the heading “Claim Construction and Insufficiencies of 
 
3 We note that even if Patent Owner had cited to Mr. Tulchin’s declaration or 
deposition testimony in support of any proposed claim construction, Mr. Tulchin 
is not qualified to opine on claim construction in this proceeding because he does 
not possess the requisite level of ordinary skill in the relevant art. See Phillips, 
415 F.3d at 1314 (“[T]he ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the 
meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in 
question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the 
patent application.”); Multiform Desiccants, Inc. v. Medzam, Ltd., 133 F.3d 1473, 
1477 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (“It is the person of ordinary skill in the field of the 
invention through whose eyes the claims are construed.”). 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
13 
the Prior Art.” Sur-Reply Br. 7–16. The section, however, does not present any 
support, intrinsic or extrinsic, for Patent Owner’s proposed claim constructions, 
focusing instead on the reasons why the prior art allegedly does not disclose 
“distribution” or “storage” or an “exhibitor,” as Patent Owner proposes to 
construe those terms. Id. at 13–16. Thus, Patent Owner has identified no evidence 
in the record to support its position that the claim terms listed above should be 
construed as narrowly as Patent Owner proposes. 
Petitioner argues that no term requires explicit construction to resolve the 
grounds presented in the Petition, and provides several reasons why Patent 
Owner’s proposed constructions should not be adopted. Reply Br. 2–11. 
Petitioner argues that if any of the terms identified by Patent Owner are 
construed, they should have the following meanings: 
“Exhibition”: According to Petitioner, “Claim 1 does not include an 
“exhibition” step, but dependent Claim 5 recites ‘the exhibition of multimedia is 
the public showing of a motion picture.’ . . . Under the doctrine of claim 
differentiation, broader independent Claim 1 is not so limited.” Reply Br. 9 
(citing Ex. 1001, code (57), 1:20–25, 2:64–65, 3:23–26, 4:20–27, 6:8–10, 11:64–
12:4, 12:38–44, 15:46–60, 16:58–63, 17:14–15, Fig. 1). 
“Exhibitor”: According to Petitioner, “the term ‘exhibitor’ must be 
construed—if at all—broad enough to cover entities not specifically ‘in the 
exhibition business.’” Id. at 7 (citing Ex. 1001, Fig. 1, 4:20–27, 12:38–44 
(disclosing that exhibitors may include “schools, libraries, and other non–profit 
organizations”)). 
“Broadcast Exhibitor”: Petitioner argues that “‘Broadcast exhibitor’ should 
be construed—if at all— broad enough to encompass the disclosed embodiments, 
including various exhibitors that may not conduct ‘over–the–air’ broadcasting 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
14 
(e.g., satellite and cable television operators), and not limited to a particular 
business context.” Id. at 8–9 (citing Ex. 1001, 4:20–23, 16:58–63, Fig. 1). 
“Distribution”: Petitioner further argues that “‘distribution’ should be 
construed—if at all—broad enough to encompass the disclosed embodiments, 
which include the distribution of other types of multimedia to any type of 
exhibitor contemplated in the specification and the technical steps required for 
distribution as recited in the claims and specification. The construction should 
also not be limited to a particular business context and cannot be understood to 
exclude ‘downloading.’” Id. at 6 (citing Ex. 1001, Abstract, 1:20–25, 2:48–51, 
3:17–19, 16:19–20). 
“Marketing”: According to Petitioner, “‘marketing’ should be construed—
if at all—broad enough to encompass generally creating interest in a public 
showing or broadcast of some multimedia content.” Id. at 4 (citing Ex. 1001, 
4:20–27, 12:38–44, 16:58, Fig. 1). 
“Storing”: Finally, Petitioner contends that “‘storing’ should be 
construed—if at all—broad enough to encompass appropriate data storage media 
regardless of whether it is volatile or non–volatile.” Id. at 7 (citing Ex. 1001, 
14:54–15:3, 16:26–28, 16:43–46, 16:55–57, Figs. 1, 9). 
When interpreting the meaning of a claim, “we need only construe terms 
‘that are in controversy, and only to the extent necessary to resolve the 
controversy.’” Nidec Motor Corp. v. Zhongshan Broad Ocean Motor Co., 868 
F.3d 1013, 1017 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting Vivid Techs., Inc. v. Am. Sci. & Eng’g, 
Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed. Cir. 1999)). Patent Owner has, briefly, proposed six 
claim terms for construction: exhibition; exhibitor; broadcast exhibitor; 
distribution; marketing; and storing. PO Resp. 10. The Petition states that “[t]o 
resolve the grounds presented herein, Petitioner does not believe that any term 
requires explicit construction.” Pet. 12.  

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
15 
We see no reason why “exhibition” and “exhibitor” should be understood 
as having a meaning as narrow as Patent Owner proposes. “Exhibition” and 
“exhibitor” encompass more than just a showing by “one in the exhibition 
business” because the specification of the ’725 patent identifies certain 
“exhibitors” that are not “in the exhibition business”: e.g., a high school, 
libraries, and other non-profit organizations. Ex. 1001, 12:38–41 (“schools, 
libraries, and other non-profit organizations”), Fig. 1 (“high school”). The plain 
and ordinary meaning of “exhibitors” is at least broad enough to encompass the 
types of exhibitors identified in the specification: movie theaters, television 
stations, satellite television operators, cable television operators, and non-profit 
organizations such as high schools. Ex. 1001, 4:20–22, Fig. 1. We further 
determine that some of these exhibitor types, including at least satellite and cable 
television operators, are “broadcast exhibitors.” 
Moreover, we find that the plain and ordinary meaning of the term 
“distribution” is not so narrow as to be limited to “the business of marketing films 
and providing copies to venues,” as Patent Owner proposes. See PO Resp. 10 
(emphasis added). The claimed invention is a “method of marketing and 
distributing multimedia,” which is not limited to films. We agree with Petitioner 
that the term is at least broad enough to encompass distribution of any type of 
multimedia to any type of exhibitor contemplated in the specification. See 
Ex. 1001, 1:20–25 (multimedia types); Reply Br. 6.  
Similarly, the plain and ordinary meanings of “marketing” and “storing” 
are not limited to Patent Owner’s specific examples: interesting individuals in 
seeing a film and saving to non-volatile storage, respectively. See PO Resp. 10; 
Tr. at 57:3–7. The invention is directed to marketing and distributing multimedia, 
not just films, Ex. 1001, 16:21, and while the Specification refers to storing 
multimedia on “hard drives,” id. at 4:35–37, 4:44–52, there is nothing in the 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
16 
Specification, claims, or prosecution history that would limit storage only to hard 
drives or other non-volatile storage. 
The intrinsic evidence suggests that the proper construction of each 
disputed term is considerably broader than that which Patent Owner has 
proposed. Accordingly, we reject Patent Owner’s proposed constructions and 
instead interpret the challenged claims according to their plain and ordinary 
meaning. 
IV. OBVIOUSNESS 
Petitioner alleges that claims 1, 4–7, 9, and 11 of the ’725 patent are 
unpatentable for obviousness over the cited prior art. Pet. 1, 3. For the reasons 
discussed below, we determine that Petitioner has provided persuasive evidence 
and argument in support of its obviousness challenges. We discuss the asserted 
prior art, and the combination of the prior art, in Section IV.B below. In Sections 
IV.C.1 and IV.C.2, we consider whether the combination of Garfinkle and 
Kosten teaches each element of claims 1, 4–7, and 9. In Section IV.C.3, we 
consider whether the combination of Garfinkle, Kosten, and Allen teaches each 
element of claim 11. In Section IV.D, we consider Patent Owner’s objective 
evidence of nonobviousness and weigh it against the evidence of obviousness 
provided by Petitioner. 
Because consideration of Petitioner’s first two grounds results in 
unpatentability of all challenged claims, we do not address Petitioner’s remaining 
grounds. See SAS Inst. Inc. v. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348, 1359 (2018) (holding a 
petitioner “is entitled to a final written decision addressing all of the claims it has 
challenged” (emphasis added)); Boston Scientific Scimed, Inc. v. Cook Grp. Inc., 
809 F. App’x. 984, 990 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (non-precedential) (recognizing that the 
“Board need not address issues that are not necessary to the resolution of the 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
17 
proceeding” and, thus, agreeing that the Board has “discretion to decline to 
decide additional instituted grounds once the petitioner has prevailed on all its 
challenged claims”).  
A. Legal Framework 
A claim is unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 103 if the differences between 
the claimed subject matter and the prior art are such that the subject matter, as a 
whole, would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. KSR, 550 U.S. 
at 406. “Once all relevant facts are found, the ultimate legal determination [of 
obviousness] involves the weighing of the fact findings to conclude whether the 
claimed combination would have been obvious to an ordinary artisan.” Arctic Cat 
Inc. v. Bombardier Recreational Prods. Inc., 876 F.3d 1350, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 
2017). Relevant factors include: (1) the scope and content of the prior art; (2) any 
differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior art; (3) the level of 
ordinary skill in the art; and (4) objective evidence of nonobviousness, if present. 
See Graham, 383 U.S. at 17–18. “[O]bjective evidence of nonobviousness 
includes copying, long felt but unsolved need, failure of others, commercial 
success, unexpected results created by the claimed invention, unexpected 
properties of the claimed invention, licenses showing industry respect for the 
invention, and skepticism of skilled artisans before the invention.” In re Rouffet, 
149 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (internal citations omitted). For objective 
evidence of nonobviousness to be given substantial weight, “its proponent must 
establish a nexus between the evidence and the merits of the claimed invention.” 
Wyers v. Master Lock Co., 616 F.3d 1231, 1246 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

B. The Asserted Prior Art and Motivation to Combine 
We begin with a review of the prior art references cited in Grounds 1 and 2 
of the Petition. The relevant references are Garfinkle and Kosten, as well as Allen 
for Ground 2 only. 
1. Garfinkle (Ex. 1005) 
Garfinkle discloses a video-on-demand (“VOD”) system that provides 
access at local user sites to catalog data of video products available from a central 
station. Ex. 1005, 1:54–57. Figure 1 of Garfinkle is reproduced below: 
 
Garfinkle Figure 1 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a video-on-
demand system. Ex. 1005, 2:20–22. Central station 10 includes an inventory of 
video products stored in product store memory 12. Id. at 2:40–44. “In addition, 


IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
19 
the central station 10 has a digital data bank 14 in which is stored catalog 
information identifying the video products available in product store 12 and 
certain materials related to these products.” Id. at 2:44–47. The catalog data is 
periodically transferred to user sites 18, where it is stored. Id. at 2:1–3. “This 
catalog data includes listings of the video products available at the central station, 
so-called trailers or previews for certain of the video products, and lead-ins for 
the initial portions of certain products to provide a seamless lead in to program 
material ordered from the central station.” Id. at 2:4–8.  
In a preferred embodiment, “menu driven software allows a user to control 
the display of catalog data and to order video products from the central station 
interactively with displayed catalog material.” Id. at 2:9–12. Within user site 18, 
control processor 20 couples catalog store 22 memory and product store 24 
memory to video display 26, such as a CRT video display or a LCD video 
display. Id. at 3:19–21. User input device 28 allows the user to “use the catalog 
data stored in catalog store 22 to, in some cases, preview video products available 
from the central station 10, and to order any available video product in the 
catalog store.” Id. at 3:26–31. 
2. Kosten (Ex. 1007) 
Kosten is a trade journal article that discloses “[i]mproved feature film 
distribution.” Ex. 1007, 54. Kosten includes the following figure: 

IPR2024-00736 
Patent 7,574,725 B2 
20 
 
The Kosten figure reproduced above depicts a studio transferring a film to a 
“CyberStar Network Operations Center,” which in turn transmits the film and 
related content by satellite to a theater, which stores the content on a video server. 
Ex. 1007, 54. The server is also connected to a “modem for accounting.” Id. The 
Figure indicates that the data stored on the video server may be forwarded to one 
or more theater screens (using a video projector and a digital audio processor), or 
to one or more lobby displays that show advertising and/or trailers. Id. 
Kosten describes a system in which “[a] digital film file is simply 
transferred to and stored in the secure server system of a satellite distribution 
company, which then ‘beams’ the film to theatres across the U.S. or around the 
world, who then store it on their servers for later digital projection.” Ex. 1007, 
54. Kosten also states that “[i]mproved feature film distribution is only one of the 
many benefits ushered in by this distribution process. Exhibitors could turn 
theatre lobbies into smart advertising networks, targeting digital trailers and ad 
spots based on the demographic of their community and the film itself.” Id.
