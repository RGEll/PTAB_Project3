Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 134(a), Appellant1 appeals from the 
Examiner’s decision to reject claims 1–20. See Final Act. 1. We have 
jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b). 
We AFFIRM. 
 
1 “Appellant” refers to “applicant” as defined in 37 C.F.R. § 1.42. Appellant

CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER 
The claims are directed to an integrated circuit testing system and 
method. Claim 1, reproduced below, illustrates the claimed subject matter: 
1. A method of testing an integrated circuit, the method 
comprising: 
 connecting a conductive line to a ground voltage; 
 directly physically contacting the conductive line with a 
first conductive structure without marring the first conductive 
structure; 
 contacting the conductive line with a second conductive 
structure different from the first conductive structure; 
 supplying a first test voltage to the conductive line 
through the first conductive structure; 
 supplying a second test voltage to the conductive line 
through the second conductive structure; and 
 generating a report indicating whether the first 
conductive structure is capable of carrying the first test voltage 
based on feedback from a first test circuit connected to the first 
conductive structure.

OPINION 
THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION BASED ON SPUHLER, WU, AND FJELSTAD 
Claims 1–3, 8–10, and 17–20 
Appellant asserts that the combination of Spuhler and Fjelstad would 
render Spuhler unsatisfactory for its intended purpose. Appeal Br. 8. 
According to Appellant, to satisfy the claim language of “directly physically 
contacting,” Spuhler must be modified to remove the LAND 128, which as 
shown below in Figure 5, is between the node 154, i.e. conductive line, and 
solder balls 124, i.e. first conductive structure. Id.

Spuhler’s Figure 5 Depicting An Exemplary Embodiment 
With LANDS Contacting Solder Balls 
Appellant maintains that removal of the LAND 128 would reduce the 
effectiveness of Spuhler and render Spuhler unsatisfactory for its intended 
purpose “of accurately evaluating the condition of solder joints in the 
electronic package.” Appeal Br. 8; Reply Br. 4.  
More particularly, Appellant argues that removal of LAND 128 would 
remove Spuhler’s ability to detect failures in the printed wired board (PWB) 
LAND interface. Appeal Br. 9. Appellant explains that Spuhler’s stated 
purpose is to detect failures at multiple locations and that  


Appeal 2024-004096 
Application 17/076,088 
5 
One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that whether a 
failure occurs at a first location or at a second location, the overall 
result is that the entire device fails. Sampling at just a singl e 
location, instead of the multiple locations of Spuhler, reduces the 
likelihood of precisely identifying whether “any such failure will 
result in a defective electronic package. ” The modification 
asserted by the Examiner reduces the number of testing locations 
by half. This reduction in testing locations will increase the risk 
of producing a defective device, which Spuhler is explicitly 
described as seeking to avoid. One of ordinary skill in the art 
would understand that removing the ability to detect failure at the 
PWB/LAND interface would inhibit Spuhler from helping to 
ensure high overall device yield. 
Appeal Br. 9–10. See also, e.g., Reply Br. 4 (citing Spuhler’s background to 
show that the PWB LAND and solder ball interface is a location typical for 
failures and asserting that performing a test that excludes a typical location 
of failures “will inherently reduce the effectiveness of a determining the 
presence of defects by failing to test a location where defects typically 
occur” and the further the test “result would be degraded to the point of 
being usable.”). 
We are not persuaded of error in the Examiner’s rejection and adopt 
the Examiner’s findings and conclusions as our own. See, e.g., Final Act. 2–
7; Ans. 3–7. As the Examiner points out (Ans. 6), “[t]he test for obviousness 
is not whether the features of a secondary reference may be bodily 
incorporated into the structure of the primary reference . . . . Rather, the test 
is what the combined teachings of those references would have suggested to 
those of ordinary skill in the art.” In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 425 (CCPA 
1981). The Examiner, here, relies on the teachings of the reference as a 
whole to arrive at the claimed limitation. See, e.g., Ans. 6. Moreover, we 
understand Spuhler’s LAND 128 to be a contact of the node 154, i.e. 

Appeal 2024-004096 
Application 17/076,088 
6 
conductive line. Given the broad disclosure of conductive line in the 
Specification, a skilled artisan would understand Spuhler’s LAND is part of 
Spuhler’s conductive line.  See Spec. ¶ 25 (noting that “[i]n some 
embodiments, conductive line 113 is a conductive plane.”).  
Nevertheless, even if the Examiner’s combination did require LAND 
128 removal, Appellant fails to identify persuasive support for the alleged 
intended purpose of Spuhler nor does Appellant persuasively explain how 
the proposed combination would render Spuhler unsatisfactory for that 
alleged purpose. As the Examiner explains, the cited portions of Spuhler 
identify that failures may occur at the PWB LAND and solder ball interface, 
but not that the interface is “specifically being used to determine whether 
failures are likely to occur within the electronic package.” Ans. 4. For 
example, Spuhler, at cited column 3, lines 5–42, describes different failure 
types, such as intermittent and hard failures, different failure evaluation 
mechanisms, such as temperature operation and storage tests, and different 
methods of analyzing solder joints, such as with or without opening the 
package. See also Ans. 4–5. As noted by the Examiner, we find no support 
in the cited disclosures for Appellant’s assertion that Spuhler uses the solder 
ball and LAND interface to determine “whether failures are likely to occur 
within the electronic package resulting in defects.” Appeal Br 8.    
Moreover, Appellant does not demonstrate that removal of Spuhler’s 
LAND would reduce the overall effectiveness of Spuhler’s testing. As the 
Examiner explains,  
Because the internal solder-joint connections are tested directly, 
a test of the solder -joint/LAND interface is not required to 
determine the connectivity of the internal solder -joint 
connections. In other words, the internal solder-joint connections 
are t ested even in the absence of LAND 128. Therefore, the 

Appeal 2024-004096 
Application 17/076,088 
7 
ability to detect failure does not reduce the number of testing 
locations by half, does not increase the risk of producing a 
defective device and does not inhibit Spuhler from ensuring high 
overall yield. 
Ans. 7. As such, based on the record before us, we are not persuaded in the 
Examiner’s determination.  
Finally, contrary to Appellant’s assertion (Reply Br. 5–7), we do not 
understand the Examiner to modify the rejection to rely on internal 
connections of Spuhler instead of the cited node 154 and solder ball 128. 
Rather, the Examiner, in responding to Appellant’s unsatisfactory for 
intended use argument, explains that Spuhler is directed to testing a variety 
of locations, such as testing the internal connection, such that removing one 
or more interfaces does not render the entire testing device unusable or less 
effective. Ans.  4–5, 7.  
Accordingly, we affirm the rejection of claims 1–3, 8–10, and 17–20 
under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as unpatentable over Spuhler, Wu, and Fjelstad. 
 
THE REMAINING OBVIOUSNESS REJECTIONS  
Claims 4–7 and 11–16  
Appellant does not present separate arguments of patentability for 
claims 4–7 and 11–16, but instead rely on the arguments presented for claim 
1. See, e.g., Appeal Br. 11–12. As discussed above, we are not persuaded of 
error in the Examiner’s rejection of claim 1. Similarly, for the same reasons, 
we are also not persuaded of error in the Examiner’s rejections of 4–7 and 
11–16 and affirm the rejections of these claims.     
CONCLUSION 
The Examiner’s rejections are AFFIRMED.
