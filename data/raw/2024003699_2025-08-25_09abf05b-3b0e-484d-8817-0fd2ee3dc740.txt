DECISION ON APPEAL 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 134(a), Appellant1 appeals from the 
Examiner’s decision to reject claims 11–21.  See Final Act. 1.  We have 
jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b). 
We AFFIRM IN PART. 
CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER 
Appellant’s invention relates to “a method and system for onboard 
diagnosis (OBD) in a vehicle, in particular, a motor vehicle,” and “to the 
 
1 “Appellant” refers to “applicant” as defined in 37 C.F.R. § 1.42.  Appellant 
identifies the real party in interest as Bayerische Motoren Werke 
Aktiengesellschaft.  Appeal Br. 2.

improved coverage of a real driving behavior to carry out onboard 
diagnoses, for example, of exhaust-gas-influencing systems or subsystems in 
vehicles.”  Spec. ¶ 1.  Claims 11, 18, and 19, reproduced below as the 
independent claims on appeal, represent the claimed subject matter. 
11.  A method for onboard diagnosis in a vehicle, the 
method comprising: 
determining whether one or more release conditions for a 
start of an onboard diagnosis are fulfilled; 
upon determining that at least one release condition of 
the one or more release conditions is not fulfilled, controlling at 
least one vehicle function in such a way that the at least one 
release condition is fulfilled; and 
starting the onboard diagnosis. 
18.  A computer program product comprising a non-
transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon 
program code which, when executed on one or more 
processors, carries out acts of:  
determining whether one or more release conditions for a 
start of an onboard diagnosis are fulfilled; 
upon determining that at least one release condition of 
the one or more release conditions is not fulfilled, controlling at 
least one vehicle function in such a way that the at least one 
release condition is fulfilled; and 
starting the onboard diagnosis. 
19.  A system for onboard diagnosis in a vehicle, the 
system comprising one or more processors which are 
configured to execute a method comprising:  
determining whether one or more release conditions for a 
start of an onboard diagnosis are fulfilled;

upon determining that at least one release condition of 
the one or more release conditions is not fulfilled, controlling at 
least one vehicle function in such a way that the at least one 
release condition is fulfilled; and 
starting the onboard diagnosis. 
Appeal Br. 12–14 (Claims App.). 
THE REFERENCES 
The Examiner relies on the following references to reject the claims: 
Name Reference Date 
Yamaki US 2002/0161495 A1 Oct. 31, 2002

THE REJECTIONS 
The Examiner maintains the following rejections: 
Claim(s) Rejected 35 U.S.C. § Reference(s)/ Basis 
11–16, 18–21 103 Yamaki, Tomura 
17 103 Yamaki, Tomura, Inoue 
 
OPINION 
Obviousness in view of Yamaki and Tomura:  Claims 11–16 and 18–21 
Independent claim 11 and dependent claims 12–16  
 The Examiner finds that claim 11 is “properly rejected under Yamaki 
due to the conditional language.”  Ans. 4.  In support, the Examiner finds 
that “[t]he method of claim 11 contains contingent limitations (e.g., ‘upon 
determining’) and includes steps that are not required to be performed when 
the conditional precedent is not met.”  Id.  The Examiner concludes, 

Appeal 2024-003699 
Application 17/425,468 
4 
therefore, that “the contingent step is not required by the broadest reasonable 
interpretation of the claim.”  Id. at 4–5 (citing MPEP 2111.04, Section II; Ex 
parte Schulhauser, Appeal No. 2013-007847, 2016 WL 6277792 (PTAB 
Apr. 28, 2016) (precedential)). 
Appellant argues that the step of controlling at least one vehicle 
function “is not contingent upon a condition precedent,” but, rather, 
“explicitly requires the step to be performed,” because the claim term 
“upon” is distinguishable from the term “if” that was the subject of the 
precedential decision in Schulhauser.  Reply Br. 3–4 (citing Ex parte Erhart, 
Appeal No. 2019-004505 (PTAB Jan. 8, 2021) (routine decision)).   
We are not persuaded by Appellant’s argument.  Claim 11 recites a 
method that requires the performance of a step upon determining that at least 
one release condition of the one or more release conditions is not fulfilled.  
We agree with the Examiner that this claimed step is performed only if such 
a determination is made and that this claimed step is not performed if such a 
determination is not made.  Therefore, according to claim 11 as written, the 
claimed step of controlling at least one vehicle function in such a way that 
the at least one release condition is fulfilled is a conditional limitation, in 
that it will only occur upon determining that at least one release condition of 
the one or more release conditions is not fulfilled.  According to 
Schulhauser, conditional steps employed in a method claim need not be 
found in the prior art if, under the broadest reasonable construction, the 
method need not invoke the steps.  2016 WL 6277792, at 5.  Thus, the 
Examiner need not find that Tomura discloses the conditional limitation (i.e., 
“upon determining . . . , controlling . . . .”).   

Appeal 2024-003699 
Application 17/425,468 
5 
The Examiner relies on Yamaki for disclosing the remaining steps of 
claim 11, including the steps of merely determining whether one or more 
release conditions for a start of an onboard diagnosis is fulfilled and starting 
the onboard diagnosis.  Appellant does not apprise us of error in these 
findings by the Examiner relevant to Yamaki.  See Appeal Br. 6–8 (arguing 
that Yamaki “teaches away” from the Examiner’s proposed modification of 
Yamaki to include the “upon determining” claim limitation, in view of 
Tomura). 
Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner’s rejection of independent 
claim 11.  Claims 12 to 16 depend from independent claim 11 and further 
limit the conditional step of controlling at least one vehicle function as 
recited in claim 11, without changing the conditional nature of the claimed 
subject matter under the broadest reasonable interpretation set forth supra.  
Thus, we also sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claims 12 to 16 in view of 
Yamaki. 
Independent claim 18 
Independent claim 18 recites “[a] computer program product” and, 
therefore, we decline to apply Schulhauser in the interpretation of claim 18, 
because claim 18 is not a method claim.  See Schulhauser, 2016 WL 
6277792, at 7 (determining that a system claim requires structure for 
performing the function should the condition occur). 
The Examiner relies on Yamaki, which relates to an on-board vehicle 
control unit with a self-diagnosis system (Yamaki ¶ 4), for disclosing, inter 
alia, a computer program product with program code for carrying out the 
acts of “determining whether one or more release conditions for a start of an 
onboard diagnosis are fulfilled” and “starting the onboard diagnosis.”  Final 

Appeal 2024-003699

6 
Act. 11 (citing Yamaki ¶ 64); see also Yamaki, Fig. 6 (depicting a flowchart 
that illustrates determining whether a diagnosis running condition is 
satisfied, and, if not, ending the diagnosis, and if so, continuing with the 
diagnosis).   
The Examiner determines that Yamaki fails to disclose the claimed 
step of, upon determining that at least one release condition of one or more 
release conditions is not fulfilled, controlling at least one vehicle function in 
such a way that the at least one release condition is fulfilled.  Final Act. 11.   
The Examiner relies on Tomura, which relates to stopping an engine 
automatically when a predefined stopping condition is met (i.e., idle stop 
control) (see, e.g., Tomura ¶ 3), for disclosing, generally, “an electrical 
control unit system . . . [that] control[s] at least one vehicle function in a way 
to fulfill a condition (“F=1” in S12) when it is not originally fulfilled (S10).”   
Final Act. 6 (citing, e.g., Tomura ¶¶ 49, 59, Fig. 3).   
The Examiner provides an annotated Figure 3 of Tomura, reproduced 
below. 

Appeal 2024-003699 
Application 17/425,468

The Examiner’s annotated Figure 3 of Tomura depicts a flowchart of the 
steps of a method for an idle stop control, wherein the Examiner has drawn a 
box around steps S10, S12 and S14.  Final Act. 13.  The flowchart shows, as 
an initial step S10, that an idle stop & start electrical control unit (ISS-ECU) 
“determine[s] whether a value of an automatic stop flag F is 1 or 0, where 
the value of 0 indicates that the automatic stopping of the engine 10 has not 
been performed and the value of 1 indicates that the automatic stopping of 
the engine 10 has been performed.”  Tomura ¶ 46.  The flowchart depicts 


Appeal 2024-003699 
Application 17/425,468 
8 
that if the condition of the automatic stopping of the engine 10 is “YES” 
(i.e., “F=1”), the method continues by performing steps that are not relevant 
to the Examiner’s findings with respect to the claim (i.e., steps S16, S18, 
S20, and S22).  On the other hand, the flowchart depicts that if the condition 
of the automatic stopping of the engine 10 is “NO” (i.e., “F=0”), the method 
continues by performing step S12, which checks if certain stopping 
conditions have been met, and, if such stopping conditions have been met, 
the method continues to step S14, which performs “Automatic Stopping,” 
such that “F=1”.   
 The Examiner finds that “the value ‘F=1’ is a ‘release condition,’” as 
claimed (Ans. 6), and, therefore, Tomura’s Figure 3 illustrates that upon 
determining that at least one release condition is not fulfilled (i.e., “F=0”), 
Tomura teaches “controlling at least one function in such a way that the at 
least one release condition is fulfilled” by controlling the automatic stopping 
of the vehicle, such that F=1.  Id.; see also Final Act. 9–10 (also referring to 
step S12).  Notably, Tomura teaches that, when restarting the engine, it is 
important “to ensure the driving force of the vehicle and proper application 
of the braking force to the wheel.”  Tomura ¶ 10. 
 The Examiner reasons that it would have been obvious to modify 
Yamaki’s onboard diagnosis (OBD) system, which monitors vehicle 
maintenance conditions, “to incorporate controlling at least one vehicle 
function such that a condition is fulfilled,” as taught in Tomura, “‘to ensure 
the driving force of the vehicle and proper application of the braking force to 
the wheel, according to various situations of the vehicle.’”  Final Act. 13 
(quoting Tomura ¶ 10).  The Examiner further reasons that “[o]ne having 
ordinary skill in the art would further recognize that it would have been 

Appeal 2024-003699 
Application 17/425,468 
9 
obvious to perform controlling in a way (e.g., regulating engine status) that 
would satisfy a release condition, such as the stopping of a vehicle engine, 
because stopping the vehicle to perform a vehicle diagnosis would enhance 
reliability of the vehicle control.  Ans. 5 (citing Tomura ¶ 40). 
 Appellant argues that “the portion of Tomura cited in support of a 
motivation to modify Yamaki is not relevant to the quoted claim feature.”  
Appeal Br. 8; see also id. at 10 (indicating that the same arguments 
presented for independent claim 11 are being made for independent claims 
18 and 19).  In support, Appellant submits that Tomura, as relied on by the 
Examiner, relates to “vehicle-mounted devices during automatic stoppage of 
the engine.”  Id. at 8.   
 We are persuaded by Appellant’s argument.  In the context of idle 
stop control, Tomura discloses the advantages of ensuring sufficient vehicle 
driving force and proper brake application in the event the automatic stop 
has not been performed; however, we agree with Appellant that the 
Examiner does not provide a sufficient factual basis as to why these 
advantages support modifying Yamaki’s OBD system relative to 
maintenance conditions.  In other words, the Examiner does not sufficiently 
explain why ensuring vehicle driving force and proper brake application in 
the context of stopping an engine is relevant to determining whether 
Yamaki’s diagnosis release conditions are satisfied to complete an onboard 
diagnostic check of a vehicle.  The Examiner’s characterization of Tomura’s 
automatic stoppage as “regulating engine status” appears to be improper 
hindsight, as Appellant’s Specification discloses, in the context of 
controlling a vehicle function to fulfill a release condition in order to start 
the onboard diagnosis, that “the release conditions can be achieved by 

Appeal 2024-003699 
Application 17/425,468 
10 
controlling or regulating at least one vehicle function, for example, a simple 
regulation of the engine status.”  Spec. ¶ 9.  
 Accordingly, we do not sustain the Examiner’s rejection of 
independent claim 18. 
Independent claim 19 and dependent claims 20 and 21 
 The Examiner relies on the same deficient reasoning from Tomura in 
the rejection of independent claim 19 as relied on in the rejection of 
independent claim 18.  Final Act. 15–16.  Therefore, for the same reasons as 
stated supra, we also do not sustain the Examiner’s rejection of independent 
claim 19 and claims 20 and 21 depending therefrom.   
 
Obviousness in view of Yamaki, Tomura, and Inoue:  Dependent claim 17 
 Claim 17 depends from independent claim 11 and, similar to 
dependent claims 12 to 16, further limits the conditional step of controlling 
at least one vehicle function as recited in claim 11, without changing the 
conditional nature of the claimed subject matter under the broadest 
reasonable interpretation set forth supra.  Thus, we also sustain the 
Examiner’s rejection of claim 17 in view of Yamaki.
