CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER 
Claim 27, the sole independent claim, is reproduced below.   
27. A method for heating a stream, the method 
comprising: 
compressing a stream comprising CO2 to form a 
compressed stream comprising CO2; 
firstly, heating the compressed stream comprising CO2 in 
a recuperator heat exchanger with heat withdrawn from a 
stream of combustion products arising from combustion of a 
first fuel source; and 
secondly, heating the compressed stream comprising CO2 
with heat obtained by oxidizing, without substantial 
combustion, a second fuel source that is a dilute stream of one 
or more gaseous hydrocarbons, said oxidizing being carried out 
separate from the combustion of the first fuel source. 
Appeal Br. 20 (Claims App.).

ANALYSIS 
Written Description Rejection of Claims 27–33 and 35 
The Examiner determines that “heat obtained by oxidizing, without 
substantial combustion, a second fuel source” is not described sufficiently in 
the Specification.  Final Act. 8.  The Examiner finds that the Specification 
describes “thermal oxidation takes place without substantial combustion in 
that the conditions do not allow for formation of a sustained flame.”  Id. 
(quoting Spec. 14:14–15).  The Examiner finds that “there is no disclosure 
of the steps applied to achieve thermal oxidation without formation of a 
sustained flame . . . the specification does not provide enough detail to 
conclude that the [inventors] had possession of the claimed invention.”  Id.   
We agree with Appellant that the Specification describes this subject 
matter.  Appeal Br. 6–7.  A recycle CO2 stream is combined with a dilute 
hydrocarbon stream 171, and the mixture is sent through heat exchanger 120 
where it is heated by turbine exhaust to the point that hydrocarbons in dilute 
hydrocarbon stream 170 undergo thermal oxidation, without substantial 
combustion, which the Specification describes as less than 5% by volume of 
the hydrocarbon compounds may combust.  Spec. 13:28–14:22.   

Appeal 2024-002039 
Application 17/832,247 
 
4 
The Specification further describes the thermal oxidation process as 
occurring without substantial combustion because conditions for combustion 
are not met.  The mixture of recycle CO2 stream and dilute hydrocarbon 
stream is controlled so the total hydrocarbon content of the mixture is below 
the lower explosive level (“LEL”).  Spec. 15:4–13.  Thus, combustion does 
not occur when the mixture is heated in heat exchanger 120, and the process 
oxidizes the dilute hydrocarbons to CO2 and water and produces sensible 
heat for the recycle CO2 so the heat produced by the turbine exhaust can be 
preserved and used downstream in the heat exchanger.  Id. at 15:14–26.   
The Examiner further finds that it is “not clear that applicants 
possessed the invention of oxidizing a hydrocarbon without substantial 
combustion, because once the reaction is started – it will proceed to 
completion in presence of a sufficient amount of oxygen.”  Final Act. 8–9.   
We agree with Appellant that the Specification describes a stream of 
dilute hydrocarbons that is maintained at a concentration of hydrocarbons 
that is below the LEL after the stream is mixed with a recycle CO2 stream 
and sent through the heat exchanger with an entrained amount of residual O2 
at a very small concentration.  Spec. 7:29–8:5, 14:26–15:26; Appeal Br. 3.   
The thermal oxidation reactions are enabled by operating power cycle 
combustor 100 with an excess of O2 that results in residual O2 in the recycle 
CO2 stream at very small concentrations of about 0.01% by volume to about 
10% by volume, about 0.1% by volume to about 8% by volume, or about 
0.2% by volume to about 5% by volume.  This residual O2 causes the 
hydrocarbons in the dilute hydrocarbon stream that is entrained with the 
recycle CO2 stream to begin to oxidize in the channels of the power cycle 
heat exchangers as the hydrocarbons are heated.  Spec. 14:26–15:3.

Accordingly, we do not sustain the rejection of claims 27–33 and 35 
for lack of written description. 
Indefiniteness Rejection of Claims 27–33 and 35 
The Examiner determines that claim 27 is indefinite because “heat 
obtained by oxidizing, without substantial combustion, a second fuel source” 
is not understood to what degree “without substantial combustion” occurs, 
and the Specification does not define “substantial” but only gives examples 
of percentages of hydrocarbon compounds that may combust.  Final Act. 9.   
We agree with Appellant that the Specification describes oxidation of 
hydrocarbon compounds in a dilute hydrocarbon stream being without 
substantial combustion to mean at least 95% of the hydrocarbon compounds 
by volume undergo thermal oxidation while less than 5% by volume of the 
hydrocarbon compounds may combust.  Appeal Br. 7; Spec. 14:12–20.  This 
description and the ranges provide objective boundaries and guidance for a 
skilled artisan to understand what is meant by oxidation of the hydrocarbon 
compounds in the dilute hydrocarbon stream “without substantial oxidation.”  
See MPEP § 2173.05(b)(I); see also Niazi Licensing Corp. v. St. Jude Med. 
S.C., Inc., 30 F.4th 1339, 1347–49 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (explaining that terms of 
degree do not have to be defined with mathematical precision where they 
provide enough certainty in the context of the invention).  Accordingly, we 
do not sustain the rejection of claims 27–33 and 35 for indefiniteness.   
Obviousness of Claims 27, 30, and 31 Over Allam and Gerhold 
The Examiner takes the position that Allam teaches partial oxidation 
reactor 4 heats a compressed stream of CO2 with heat obtained by oxidizing, 
without substantial combustion, second fuel source 26 that is a dilute stream 
of hydrocarbons.  Final Act. 11 (citing Allam ¶ 88, Fig. 1). 

Appeal 2024-002039 
Application 17/832,247 
 
6 
We agree with Appellant that Allam’s partial oxidation (“POX”) 
reactor 4 performs a partial oxidation that combusts part of the fuel in the 
reactor to produce a stream of partial oxidation products.  Appeal Br. 8–10 
(citing Allam ¶¶ 6, 109).  Paragraph 109 of Allam indicates POX reactor 4 is 
a reactor that can combust a carbonaceous fuel.  Thus, partial oxidation of a 
fuel in Allam is understood to mean that part of the fuel in POX reactor 4 is 
combusted and the rest of the fuel is not combusted.  The Examiner has not 
shown that POX reactor 4 oxidizes a fuel without substantial combustion so 
less than 5% of the fuel is combusted in POX reactor 4.   
Accordingly, we do not sustain the rejection of claims 27, 30, and 31.   
Rejections of Dependent Claims 28, 29, 32, 33, and 35 
The Examiner’s reliance on White to teach the limitations of claim 28, 
Maslov to teach the limitations of claim 29, Kesseli to teach the limitations 
of claims 32 and 35, and Maslov to teach the limitations of claim 33 does 
not cure the above-noted deficiencies in the rejection of independent claim 
27 from which these claims all depend.  Accordingly, we do not sustain the 
rejection of claims 28, 29, 32, 33, and 35.    
Double Patenting over Forrest and Gerhold 
We agree with the Examiner that claim 1 of Forest recites a method 
that performs the claimed steps of compressing a stream comprising CO2 to 
form a compressed stream of CO2, heating the compressed stream of CO2 in 
a recuperator heat exchanger with heat withdrawn from a stream of products 
of combustion from a first fuel source, and heating the stream of compressed 
CO2 with heat from a second fuel source of a dilute stream of hydrocarbons 
that is oxidized without substantial combustion, as recited in claim 27.  Final 
Act. 5; Ans. 3.   

Appeal 2024-002039 
Application 17/832,247 
 
7 
The fact that claim 1 of Forrest recites a power production method 
does not alter the fact that it recites the steps of claim 27 of compressing a 
stream of CO2 and heating the compressed stream in a recuperator heat 
exchanger with the heat of combustion products and by oxidizing a dilute 
hydrocarbon stream without substantial combustion.  Ans. 3 (the patented 
claims may be used to anticipate the present claims); Abbvie Inc. v. The 
Mathilda and Terence Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology Trust, 764 F.3d 
1366, 1374(Fed. Cir. 2014) (a later claim that is not patentably distinct from 
or anticipated by an earlier claim is invalid for obviousness-type double 
patenting) (citations omitted).  The Examiner also reasonably determines 
that using the method of claim 1 of Forrest to heat a stream would have been 
obvious to a skilled artisan who would know that heating a stream is a step 
required for power production, so the method of claim 1 of Forrest would 
have been obvious to use to perform the method of claim 27.  Final Act. 6.   
Accordingly, we sustain the rejection of claim 27, which we select as 
representative of the claims rejected on this ground, where Appellant argues 
the rejected claims as a group.  Appeal Br. 4–5; 37 C.F.R. § 41.37(c)(1)(iv) 
(2023).  Claims 28–33 and 35 fall with claim 27.   
CONCLUSION 
We reverse the rejection of claims 27–33 and 35 under 35 U.S.C. 
§ 112(a) as lacking a written description of the claimed subject matter. 
We reverse the rejection of claims 27–33 and 35 under 35 U.S.C. 
§ 112(b) as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly 
claim the subject matter of the invention. 
We reverse the rejection of claims 27, 30, and 31 under 35 U.S.C. 
§ 103 as being unpatentable over Allam and Gerhold.
