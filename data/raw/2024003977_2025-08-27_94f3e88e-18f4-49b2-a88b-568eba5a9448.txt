 DECISION ON APPEAL1 
 STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 134, Appellant2 appeals from the Examiner’s 
decision to reject all the claims remaining in the application—claims 1–20. 
We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(b). 
We affirm. 
 CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER 
The claims are directed to restoring a database index following a 
failure. Spec. ¶ 1. Claim 1, reproduced below, illustrates the claimed subject 
matter: 
1. A method for recovering a database and restoring an index 
following a failure of the database comprising:  
receiving a change to a document in a database, the database having 
a plurality of documents;  
storing the change to the document in the database in a persistent 
data store, the persistent data store divided into a plurality of 
segments;  
updating a volatile index in volatile memory with a pointer to the 
document in the persistent data store;  
generating a shadow index in the persistent data store, wherein the 
shadow index is a persistent copy of the volatile index, and is 
not updated at the same time as the volatile index; and  
 
1 Throughout this Decision, we have considered the Specification filed 
October 8, 2018 (“Spec.”), the Final Office Action mailed November 8, 
2023 (“Final Act.”), the Appeal Brief filed April 2, 2024 (“Appeal Br.”), and 
the Examiner’s Answer mailed July 10, 2024 (“Ans”). 
2 “Appellant” refers to “applicant” as defined in 37 C.F.R. § 1.42. Appellant 
identifies the real party in interest as International Business Machines 
Corporation. Appeal Br. 1.

executing a shadow thread on the plurality of documents wherein 
the shadow thread scans each record in the persistent storage 
device to populate and update the shadow index, wherein the 
shadow thread operates as a background operation on the 
persistent data store.

 OPINION 
We are not persuaded the Examiner erred in rejecting claims 1–10 and 
14–20 under 35 U.S.C. § 103. Upon consideration of Appellant’s arguments 
(Appeal Br. 6–37; Reply Br. 4–10), we agree with the Examiner’s findings 
and rationales (Final Act. 9–23; Ans. 4–36) as fully responsive to 
Appellant’s arguments. We adopt these findings as our own and highlight 
certain points below. 
A. Claims 1–5, 8, 9, 11–16, and 18 
We select claim 1 as representative. Appellant does not separately 
argue claims 2–5, 8, 9, 11–16, and 18.  

Appeal 2024-003977 
Application 16/153,891 
4 
Appellant argues that the proposed combination of teachings of 
Pothoff, Peltonen, and Pierce do not result in the subject matter recited by 
claim 1. Appeal Br. 7–9. In particular, Appellant argues that Peltonen’s 
shadow thread indexes only those documents on a received list of identifiers 
and, therefore, does not “scan[] each record in the persistent storage” as 
recited. Id. According to Appellant, even though the Examiner relies on 
Pierce for teaching the portion of the limitation directed to operating on all 
of the documents in the shadow index, the rejection does not properly 
provide “reasoning that would involve changing the queue of Peltonen” and, 
therefore, the rejection “still maintains the concept of the queue that is in 
Peltonen.” Id. at 8.  
We are not persuaded of error in the rejection by this argument. 
Although Appellant focuses on the fact that Peltonen executes the shadow 
thread using a list of document identifiers instead of indexing every 
document, the rejection also points to Pierce as teaching this limitation. See 
Id. at 8–9 (citing Pierce 7:31–32, 7:45–49). Pierce explicitly discloses a 
“reindex process 320 . . . iterating through all of the information in database 
305.” Pierce 7:45–46. Appellant appears to concede that this is a disclosure 
of “the concept of operating on all the documents by the shadow index,” but 
asserts that “[t]he combination asserted by the Office Action still maintains 
the concept of the queue that is in Peltonen.” Appeal Br. 8.  
We disagree with this characterization of the rejection. The test for 
obviousness is what the combined teachings of the references would have 
suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art. In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 425 
(CCPA 1981). We find that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have 
understood, based on the disclosure of Pierce, that the indexing system of 

Appeal 2024-003977 
Application 16/153,891 
5 
Peltonen could be modified such that every document is included in the 
queue. KSR Intern. Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416 (2007) (“[I]f a 
technique has been used to improve one device, and a person of ordinary 
skill in the art would recognize that it would improve similar devices in the 
same way, using the technique is obvious unless its actual application is 
beyond his or her skill.”). Appellant states that “Peltonen clearly shows that 
not every document is in this queue” (Appeal Br. 8), but that does not mean 
that Peltonen teaches away from such a modification or that the modification 
would change the principle of operation of Peltonen. And Appellant does not 
point to any evidence supporting such a theory. Moreover, the record 
contains no evidence that combining Pothoff, Peltonen, and Pierce as 
proposed would have been uniquely challenging or otherwise beyond the 
level of ordinarily skilled artisans. See Leapfrog Enters., Inc. v. Fisher-
Price, Inc., 485 F.3d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  
We, therefore, agree with the Examiner’s finding that the combined 
teachings of the three references would have suggested that a person of 
ordinary skill in the art “generate a complete index of modified content of a 
database in the system of Pothoff for providing updated information for 
searching and retrieving relevant information from the database, thereby 
providing up-to-date information for [the] requesting entity.” Final Act. 9. 
Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claims 1–5, 8, 9, 
11–16, and 18. 
B. Claims 6, 7, and 17 
Appellant includes a separate section for claims 6, 7, and 17 in the 
Appeal Brief. Appeal Br. 9–10. However, this section relies on the 
arguments made for the rejections of claims 1 and 12. Id. at 10. For the 

Appeal 2024-003977 
Application 16/153,891 
6 
reasons discussed above, we sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claims 6, 7, 
and 17. 
C. Claims 10, 19, and 20 
Appellant separately argues claims 10, 19, and 20. Appeal Br. 10–12. 
However, this section repeats the arguments made for claims 1–5, 8, 9, 11–
16, and 18. See Appeal Br. 10–12. 
Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claims 10, 19, 
and 20. 
 CONCLUSION 
We affirm the Examiner’s rejections.
