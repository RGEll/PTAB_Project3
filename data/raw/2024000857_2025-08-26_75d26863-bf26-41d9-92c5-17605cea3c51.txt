CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER 
The claims are directed to drawer slide.  Claim 21, reproduced below, 
illustrates the claimed subject matter: 
21.  A method of manufacturing a drawer slide, the method  
comprising: 
milling a first elongate linear member from a single piece 
of metal, the first elongate  linear member having, as a result of 
the milling, a first end portion including a first edge, a  second 
end portion including a wall, and an interior surface defining a 
first channel extending  between the first end portion and the 
second end portion, the wall extending transversely across  the 
first channel at the second end portion; 
providing a second elongate linear member slidably 
located within the first channel, the second linear member having 
a first end portion including a first edge, a second end portion  
including a second edge, and an interior surface defining a 
second channel extending between the first end portion and the 
second end portion thereof, wherein interior side edges of the 
first elongate linear member and exterior side edges of the second 
elongate linear member further  define a first pair of raceways; 
and 
disposing a plurality of ball bearings and bearing spacers 
alternately within each of the first raceways. 
Appeal Br. 17 (“Claims App.”) (emphasis added).

Final Act. 2, 4. 
OPINION 
A. Claims 21, 22 Obviousness Over Meyer, Haxton, and Chi 
Appellant directs its arguments to the claim requirement that the first 
elongate member be “‘milled’ in order to produce a single piece of metal 
member.”  Appeal Br. 11.  The specific claim 21 language referred to states 
“milling a first elongate linear member from a single piece of metal.”  Id. 
at 17.  Appellant recognizes that the prior art references show each 
individual claimed element, but Appellant first takes issue with the 
rationales for combining Meyer and Haxton.  Id. at 11.  Specially, Appellant 
contends that Examiner’s reasoning is “incorrect” that a person of ordinary 
skill in the art would be motivated to manufacture the linear member as from 
a single piece of metal to “enable the part to be simply and automatically 
produced (i.e., formed integrally) without an assembly step of coupling the 
wall to the linear member.”  Id. (quoting Final Act. 3).  Without reference to 
any evidence of record, Appellant contends, “[t]he cost savings in avoiding 
the manual step of fixing Meyer’s stainless steel shock block 40 to the 
innermost extremity of member 10 would be negligible compared to the 
added cost associated with cutting into a solid piece of metal to form the 
member 10 and shock block 40 as a single piece.”  Id.  For this reason, 

Appeal 2024-000857 
Application 17/817,780 
4 
Appellant alleges that “a person having ordinary skill in the art would never 
have modified Meyer’s own manufacturing method, in which the stainless 
steel shock block 40 is simply ‘fixed to’ the innermost extremity of member 
10 as described at col. 2, lines 20-21 of Meyer, for cost savings as alleged.”  
Id. at 11–12. 
Appellant argues that the Examiner’s additional motivation for 
combining Meyer and Haxton is not supported by the cited references.  Id. 
at 12.  Specifically, the Examiner contends that combining Haxton’s 
teaching of a solid unitary construction into Meyer would “provid[e] a more 
robust linear member due to the solid unitary construction.”  Id. (quoting 
Final Act. 4).  Appellant contends that “what motivated the Appellant’s own 
claimed invention was the potential for constructions like Meyer’s to fail 
when the shock block 40 becomes dislodged by an impact, a possibility that 
was discovered by the inventors and is nowhere even contemplated by 
Meyer or any of the other references.”  Id.  Thus, Appellant contends that the 
prior art fails to recognize the advantages of milling a first elongate linear 
member from a single piece of metal to prevent dislodgement and create a 
more robust linear member.  Id.  
We disagree with Appellant’s contentions and agree with the 
Examiner that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been 
motivated to combine Haxton’s teaching of a solid unitary construction into 
Meyer to simplify manufacturing the linear member and achieve a more 
robust linear member.  See Ans. 4 (“The aspect of the integral formation also 
providing a more robust drawer slide, due to the solid unitary construction, 
was additionally cited in support of the combined references.”).

Application 17/817,780 
5 
Although typically, “[i]t is elementary that the construction of parts 
integral, instead of by riveting, welding, or otherwise fastening them 
together, does not amount to invention,” Appellant’s claim 1 requires that 
the elongate linear member be formed from a single piece of metal.  In re 
Hodgson, 96 F.2d 285, 286 (CCPA 1938) (citation omitted); see also 
Application of Hotte, 475 F.2d 644, 647 (CCPA 1973) (finding “integral” is 
sufficiently broad to embrace constructions united by such means as 
fastening and welding).  Indeed, in certain situations forming parts jointly as 
“a single integral and gaplessly continuous piece” may not be obvious in 
light of similar bolted prior art structures.  Carl Schenck, A.G. v. Nortron 
Corp., 713 F.2d 782, 785 (Fed. Cir. 1983).  The purposes of forming the 
claimed elongate linear member from a single piece of metal construction, 
according to Appellant’s Specification, is to create a more robust design that 
does not become dislodged:    
The wall 17 may prevent the second linear member 20 from 
sliding through the second end portion 13 of the first linear 
member 10.  Because the wall 17 is milled and part of the same 
piece from which the entirety of the first linear member 10 is 
milled, the wall 17 may not be dislodged from the impact of the 
second linear member 20 when the second linear member 20 is  
moved to the fully retracted position in the way that a separate 
piece extending across the first channel 11 might be. 
Spec. ¶ 32 (quoted in part by Appellant at Appeal Br. 10–11).  Thus, taking 
Appellant’s Specification for what it states, “milling a first elongate linear 
member from a single piece of metal” as claimed may have a specific 
purpose or function.   
Regardless, both Haxton and Meyer achieve this same function.  First, 
Haxton recognizes a similar problem and offers the same unitary

Application 17/817,780 
6 
construction for a solution, specifically, “[p]art 10 has stop area 36 at the 
back end to prevent the drawer slide from coming apart through the back of 
part 10,” as depicted below in Figure 2.  Haxton ¶ 16.  
 
 
 
Figure 2 of Haxton depicts “[a] perspective view of the drawer slide” 
showing frame part 10 that has unitary stop part 36 at the back part.  Id. 
¶¶ 19, 29.   
Second, we also agree with the Examiner “that Meyer already 
provides a secure and solid linear member with an end wall between first 
and second end portions that is able to implicitly withstand dislodgement 
upon impact.”  Ans. 7.  Accordingly, we do not find Appellant’s contentions 
persuasive.  The Examiner presents a persuasive rationale explaining why a 
person of ordinary skill in the art would have integrated Haxton’s teaching 
of a uniformly milled part 10 into Meyer to simplify manufacturing the 
linear member and achieve a more robust linear member from this unitary 
construction.  Final Act. 3; Ans. 4. 
Appellant next argues “the alleged modification would further not 
have been obvious considering Haxton’s explicit teaching away from ball

7 
bearing based mechanical drawer slides like those taught by Meyer.”  
Appeal Br. 12–13 (quoting Haxton ¶ 29 (“no ball bearings are present”)).   
The Examiner responds that Appellant’s argument is moot because 
Haxton “is only being relied upon for the cutting / milling operation that can 
be utilized when manufacturing a solid aluminum linear member of a drawer 
slide,” and Meyer teaches use of ball bearings within the drawer slide 
assembly.  Ans. 5.   
 We do not find Appellant’s argument persuasive.  Appellant has not 
shown how Haxton’s lack of ball bearings would impact the Examiner’s 
proposed combination.  First, Examiner only relies on Haxton for its 
teaching of a making a solid aluminum linear member, which is not 
impacted by ball bearings for the slide mechanism.  Next, Appellant has not 
persuasively established why a person of ordinary skill in the art would have 
been dissuaded from integrating Haxton’s unitary linear member into Meyer 
as proposed by the Examiner.  For example, there is no evidence or 
persuasive argument that Meyer’s ball bearing mechanisms would be 
impacted by Haxton’s unitary linear member.   
We sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claim 21 as obvious over 
Meyer, Haxton, and Chi.  We likewise sustain the rejection of claim 22, 
which is not separately argued by Appellant.   
 
B. Claims 21, 22 Obviousness Over Meyer, Netzer, and Chi 
The Examiner substitutes Netzer for Haxton in this combination.  See 
Final Act. 5.  The Examiner finds that “[a]s to the milling aspect, Netzer is 
cited as an evidence reference for the known technique of milling a solid 
piece of material.”  Id.  The Examiner notes that Netzer “is relied upon 

Appeal 2024-000857 
Application 17/817,780 
8 
solely for the known technique of milling out a cavity within an elongate 
member in order to remove material during a cutting / milling operation for 
the sake of enabling the member to include a recess along a length of the 
member in a simple and automatic manner.”  Ans. 5–6.  According to the 
Examiner, Netzer teaches machining an elongate member out of a solid 
piece.  Id.  Further, the Examiner determines that “it would have been 
obvious . . . to modify the manufacture of the first elongate linear member so 
as to include a milling operation in view of Netzer’s teaching because this 
arrangement would provide an alternative process for manufacturing the 
channel / recess within the linear member thereby . . . providing a more 
robust linear member due to the solid unitary construction.”  Final Act. 5–6.   
Appellant contends “that Netzer’s recess 6, which is milled out of the 
solid wood of a drawer side wall, is for the insertion of a receiving part 9 for 
the fastening of a front panel to the drawer side wall.”  Appeal Br. 14.  
According to Appellant, “[t]his is completely unrelated to the teachings of 
the Meyer reference, which are directed to a slide structure for supporting a 
drawer,” and “[a] person having ordinary skill in the art reading Meyer and 
Netzer would, at best, be motivated to use Netzer’s recess 6 in the side walls 
of a drawer that is supported by Meyer’s slide structure.  There is nothing in 
Netzer that would suggest the use of the recess 6 elsewhere.”  Id.   
The Examiner persuasively relies on Netzer for its teaching of milling 
a drawer component as a single unitary piece and then incorporating that 
into Meyer.  Netzer discloses, “[a]dvantageously, provision is made that the 
base of the recess and the drawer side wall are made unitary from a single 
piece,” and “[m]illing the recess enables the drawer side wall to be simply 
and automatically produced.”  Netzer ¶ 9.  The Examiner demonstrates 

Appeal 2024-000857 
Application 17/817,780 
9 
persuasively that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have recognized, 
based on Netzer’s teachings, that machining Meyer’s elongate member out 
of one solid piece would have created a simpler machining process.  Ans. 6.  
Specifically, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had “a 
reasonable expectation of success, to machine the elongate member out of 
one solid piece in view of Netzer [because] the automated machining of the 
linear member would be simpler than machining / fabricating an incomplete 
linear member and then adding component(s) to the member via an assembly 
step.”  Ans. 6.  The Examiner has thus provided a persuasive rationale as to 
why a person of ordinary skill in the art would replace Meyer’s member 10 
and shock block 40 assembly with an elongate linear member from a single 
piece of metal based on Netzer’s teachings of milling as a unitary single 
piece (Netzer ¶ 9).   
 Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner’s rejection of claims 21 and 22 
based on Meyer, Netzer, and Chi.    
CONCLUSION 
The Examiner’s rejection of claims 21 and 22 is Affirmed.
