CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER 
 The invention relates to substrates for composite membranes.  Spec. 
¶ 14.  Independent claim 1 reads as follows: 
 1. A substrate comprising a microporous polyolefin 
membrane, the substrate being of a mono-layer structure 
wherein: 
 the average pore size is 1 nm to 50nm; 
 the porosity is 50% to 78%; 
 the membrane thickness is 1 μm to 10 μm; 
 the Gurley value as measured according to JIS P8117 is 
90 s/100 cc or less; and 
 wherein the polyolefin consists of a polyethylene 
composition comprising a high molecular weight polyethylene 
with a mass average molecular weight of 900,000 or more and a 
low molecular weight polyethylene with a mass average 
molecular weight of 200,000 to 800,000 mixed at a mass ratio 
of 20:80 to 80:20. 
Appeal Br. 17 (Claims App.). 
 The remaining claims on appeal depend from claim 1. 
REJECTIONS

OPINION 
 We need only address the Examiner’s rejection of claim 1 to resolve 
the issues raised in this appeal. 
 Claim 1 recites, inter alia, a substrate in which “the Gurley value as 
measured according to JIS P8117 is 90 s/100 cc or less.”  The Gurley value 
represents a standardized measure of air permeability.  See Ishihara ¶ 91. 
 In rejecting claim 1, the Examiner finds Ohno discloses a 
polyethylene membrane substrate but fails to teach the recited Gurley values.  
Final Act. 3.  The Examiner finds Nishikawa discloses polyolefin 
membranes having a range of Gurley values that overlaps the recited range.  
Id.  The Examiner further finds Nishikawa teaches that the Gurley value was 
a known result-effective variable, the optimization of which would have 
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  Id.  Based on these prior art 
disclosures, the Examiner determines “it would have been obvious to one of 
ordinary skill in the art to modify the membrane of Ohno to comprise the 
claimed Gurley values.”  Id. 
 Appellant argues the Examiner has not established a reason why one 
of ordinary skill in the art would have applied Nishikawa’s disclosed Gurley 
values to Ohno’s substrate.  Appeal Br. 8.  We agree. 
 Ohno discloses a liquid filter substrate for filtering particles of about 
10–50 nm.  Ohno ¶ 21.  Nishikawa, on the other hand, discloses a range of 
Gurley values suitable for a porous base material in a battery separator.  
Nishikawa ¶¶ 56, 127.  As Appellant aptly points out (Appeal Br. 7–8), 
Nishikawa states that the disclosed range of Gurley values are suitable to 
provide a battery separator with a desired mechanical strength and electrical 
resistance.  See, e.g., Nishikawa ¶¶ 127–128.  The Examiner provides no

Application 16/319,661 
 
4 
substantiated reason as to why one of ordinary skill in the art would have 
considered Nishikawa’s Gurley values to have been relevant to Ohno’s 
liquid filter. 
 The Examiner’s reliance on Nishikawa as identifying Gurley value as 
a result-effective variable also is flawed.  First, the mere fact that Nishikawa 
teaches a range of Gurley values is not, alone, sufficient evidence that 
Gurley value would have been recognized as a result-effective variable.  
Nishikawa merely teaches that the disclosed range of Gurley values were 
considered adequate with regard to mechanical strength and electrical 
resistance of a battery separator.  Moreover, even if Nishikawa were viewed 
as teaching Gurley value as a result-effective variable, the Examiner presents 
no evidence that optimization of Gurley value for Nishikawa’s disclosed 
purpose would have been expected to result in Gurley values within the 
recited range.  As Appellant observes (Appeal Br. 7–8), Nishikawa discusses 
Gurley value with regard to mechanical strength and electrical resistance in a 
battery separator, whereas the Specification describes the recited range of 
Gurley values with regard to achieving a desired permeation of hydrophilic 
resin into the microporous membrane.  Spec. ¶ 29.  The Examiner provides 
no evidence to support a reasonable expectation that optimization for 
strength and electrical resistance would have yielded Gurley values 
optimized for resin permeation. 
 For the foregoing reasons, the Examiner’s rejections are not sustained. 
CONCLUSION 
 The Examiner’s decision rejecting claims 1, 4, 5, 7, 9–11, 21, and 23–
25 is reversed.
